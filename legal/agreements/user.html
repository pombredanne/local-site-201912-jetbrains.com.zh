<p>13.3. JetBrains may terminate this agreement if:</p>
<p>(A) User has materially breached this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of written notice thereof;</p>

<p>(C) JetBrains elects to discontinue providing Product(s), in whole or in part.</p>
<p>13.4. JetBrains will make reasonable efforts to notify User via email as follows:</p>
