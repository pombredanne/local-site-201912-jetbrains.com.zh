The IDE provides support for updated Switch Expressions and their new syntax: now if you need to return a value from a multi-line block in Java 13, you can use the yield keyword instead of break. We’ve also added support for text blocks, which allows you to embed longer multi-line blocks of text into your source code, for example, HTML or SQL. With this feature, you paste across the two formats, either escaping values when pasting into a String or leaving out the escapes when pasting into a text block.</p> </div> </div> <div class="wt-col-6"> <div class="features-block"> <div class="js-carousel-dots features-block__image _no-shadow _two-block-in-row"> <div class="gif-wrapper"> <img alt="" class="js-gif" data-gif-src="/idea/whatsnew/2019-2/img/JavaTransformToSingleExitPoint.gif" src="/idea/whatsnew/2019-2/img/JavaTransformToSingleExitPoint-1.png"> </div> <div class="gif-wrapper"> <img alt="" class="js-gif" data-gif-src="/idea/whatsnew/2019-2/img/JavaInlineMethodRefactoring1-main.gif" src="/idea/whatsnew/2019-2/img/JavaInlineMethodRefactoring1-main.png"> </div> <div class="gif-wrapper"> <img alt="" class="js-gif" data-gif-src="/idea/whatsnew/2019-2/img/JavaInlineRefactoring2.gif" src="/idea/whatsnew/2019-2/img/JavaInlineRefactoring2-1.png"> </div> </div> <h3 class="features-block__title">Refactoring methods with multiple exit points</h3> <p>We’ve added a new intention that you can run to transform a method with multiple returns into a single exit point and prepare it for the Inline Method refactoring.
