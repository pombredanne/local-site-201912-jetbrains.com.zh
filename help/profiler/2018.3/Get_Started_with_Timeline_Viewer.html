The execution time of a user method is calculated as the sum of the method's own time            and own time of all system methods it calls (down to the next user method in the stack).            <figure><img alt="t1 top methods" title="t1 top methods" src="/help/img/dotnet/2018.3/t1_top_methods.png" id="76a52d38" width="612" height="138"></figure>            As you can see, there are only two methods with meaningful execution time:            <code class="code" data-lang="Java">App.Main</code>            and            <code class="code" data-lang="Java">MainWindow.ProcessInProgress</code>.        </p></li><li class="list__item" id="1bb67718">            Look at the <span class="control">Call Tree</span>.            <figure><img alt="t1 call tree" title="t1 call tree" src="/help/img/dotnet/2018.3/t1_call_tree.png" id="c9313291" width="716" height="193"></figure>            As you can see,            <code class="code" data-lang="Java">App.Main</code>            spends most of the time in a number of system methods related to processing Windows            messages.* This is typical behavior for any application that provides a graphical user interface.            This indicates that the application waits for user            input in a message loop. We can simply ignore these methods when analyzing the snapshot. To find out what            method causes the freeze, we should look at the next user method in the stack, which turns out to be            <code class="code" data-lang="Java">MainWindow.ProcessInProgress</code>.

These computations don't look complex, so why did the freezes            occur?            Apparently, this event handler is called so often that the main window cannot cope with updating the label.
