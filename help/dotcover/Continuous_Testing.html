Obviously, all tests that have never been executed, were aborted, or did not finish for some reason            fall into this category.        </p>        <p id="e4734c3d">            Tests that have finished with a definite result (passed or failed) are relevant (not outdated),            but only until you make any change in your code.            To make sure that there are no more outdated tests after the change, you either need to re-run all tests or            re-run tests that were affected by the change.        </p>        <p id="95595069">            When continuous testing is enabled,            dotCover calculates coverage of all unit tests and monitors changes in the covered code to detect            whether any tests become outdated after a change.            When a test becomes outdated, dotCover adds the question mark to its icon, e.g.            <img alt="icon dirty test" title="icon dirty test" src="/help/img/dotnet/2019.2/icon_dirty_test.png" id="d2ca427c" width="15" height="15" class="inline-icon-15">, and changes the            <a href="#status">status indicator</a> as well.            <figure><img alt="outdated test status bar icon" title="outdated test status bar icon" src="/help/img/dotnet/2019.2/outdated_test_status_bar_icon.png" id="e746c7ee" width="272" height="58"></figure>        </p>        <p id="27fd9cec">            You can            <a href="Visualizing_Code_Coverage.html">visualize code coverage</a> to see which statements in your code are            covered by unit tests and            <a href="Navigation_to_Covering_Tests.html">navigate</a> from code to covering tests.        </p>        <p id="49948b8c">            At any time, you can clear the information about test execution result by clicking            <span class="control">Drop coverage results</span>                        <img alt="ThemedIcon JetBrainsDotCoverVsPresentationResourcesSnapshotManagementTrash Screen Gray " title="ThemedIcon JetBrainsDotCoverVsPresentationResourcesSnapshotManagementTrash Screen Gray " src="/help/img/dotnet/2019.2/ThemedIcon.JetBrainsDotCoverVsPresentationResourcesSnapshotManagementTrash.Screen.[Gray].png" id="cb8252ae" width="16" height="16" class="inline-icon-16">            on the toolbar.        </p>    </div>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="modes" data-toc="Continuous_Testing#modes">Modes of continuous testing</h2>        <p id="2e15d17d">            To select the continuous testing mode means answer two questions:            <ol class="list _decimal"><li class="list__item" id="86bcac87"><p>                    How continuous testing will be triggered? <br>                    Or, in other words, when will be tests autostarted?
