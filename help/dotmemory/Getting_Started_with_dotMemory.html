Consider this tutorial as your starting point        to dotMemory.    </p>    <div class="chapter"><h3 id="e5efee0f" data-toc="Getting_Started_with_dotMemory#e5efee0f">Basic terms</h3>        <p id="3292ed5a">            You might ask: "What are memory snapshots and why should I get them?" This is a good time to agree on some            memory            profiling terms you'll come across while using dotMemory.        </p>        <p id="a61ec210">            From memory perspective, the work of your application consists of continuous allocation of memory for new            objects and            releasing the memory left from the objects that are no longer used by the app. Objects are allocated one            after            another in the so-called managed heap. Based on this, we have two basic operations a memory profiler must be            able to do:        </p>        <ul class="list _bullet"><li class="list__item" id="6b4f25ca"><p>                Get a <span class="emphasis">memory snapshot</span>. Snapshot is an instant image of the managed heap. Each snapshot contains                the info                about all the objects that your app has allocated in memory at the moment you click the                <span class="control">Get Snapshot</span>                button.            </p></li><li class="list__item" id="c646496b"><p>                Collect <span class="emphasis">memory traffic</span> information. Memory traffic shows you how much memory was allocated and                released,                e.g., between two memory snapshots. This info is also very valuable as it allows you to understand the                dynamics of how your application performs.            </p></li></ul>        <p id="4be43213">            The time interval during which you collect traffic and get snapshots (or, in other words, profile your            application) is called <span class="emphasis">profiling session</span>.        </p>        <p id="905c6736">            Of course, there are some other terms that you'll get acquainted with while following the tutorial.

The most important thing in this operation is choosing            the right moment for it. As you remember, a snapshot is the instant image of the application's managed heap.            Thus,            the first            thing you should do before taking a snapshot is bring your application to the state you're interested in.            For            example, if we want to take a look at the objects created right after Game of Life is launched, we must            get a snapshot before taking any actions in the app. Conversely, if we need to know what objects are created            dynamically, we must take a snapshot after we click <span class="control">Start</span> in the application.        </p>        <ol class="list _decimal"><li class="list__item" id="a583ee55"><p>Let's assume we need to get info about objects allocated when Game of Life runs. Therefore, click the                <span class="control">Start</span>                button in the application and let the game run for a while.            </p></li><li class="list__item" id="12a4c857"><p>                Click the <span class="control">Get Snapshot</span> button in dotMemory.                <figure><img alt="tutorial1 session 1" title="tutorial1 session 1" src="/help/img/dotnet/2019.2/tutorial1_session_1.png" id="9f040f3d" width="700" height="488"></figure>                This will capture the data and add the snapshot to the snapshot area. Getting a snapshot doesn't                interrupt                the profiling process, thus allowing us to get another snapshot (not needed for now).            </p></li><li class="list__item" id="c200ec06"><p>End the profiling session by closing the Game of Life window.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="07536a15">                Look at dotMemory.

In the example below, objects D and F will be removed from memory as they cannot be                accessed from the application's roots.            </p>            <figure><img alt="primer gc" title="primer gc" src="/help/img/dotnet/2019.2/primer_gc.png" id="3a8bb907" width="364" height="296"></figure>        </div>        <div class="chapter"><h3 id="91a0be73">Retention</h3>            <p id="3abfeb6f">                Here we come to the crucial concept of <i id="f2e295da">retention</i>.            </p>            <p id="89549be1">                A path from roots to an object may lead through a number of other objects. If all paths to the object B                pass                through                the object A, then A is a <i id="40c2be96">dominator</i> for B. In other words, B is retained in memory exclusively by                A.                If A is                garbage-collected, B will also be garbage-collected. That is why the most important parameter of each                object is                the size of the objects it retains. In dotMemory, this parameter is called                <span class="control">Retained bytes</span>. For instance, object C in the example below retains 632 bytes.                Object B is not exclusively retained by C; therefore, it is not                included in the calculation.            </p>            <figure><img alt="primer retention" title="primer retention" src="/help/img/dotnet/2019.2/primer_retention.png" id="7eb753e8" width="281" height="295"></figure>            <p id="aaea5d35">                Let's return to dotMemory and take a look at the opened                <span class="control">Group by Types</span>                view.

As you can see, the major part is                retained by the                <code class="code">System.Windows.Shapes.Ellipse</code>                class (apparently, these are ellipse shapes we use to visualize                Game of Life cells). Objects of that type retain 11,864,580 bytes of memory, while consuming 3,862,600                bytes by themselves.            </p>            <figure><img alt="tutorial1 plain list" title="tutorial1 plain list" src="/help/img/dotnet/2019.2/tutorial1_plain_list.png" id="0da7fc19" width="735" height="314"></figure>            <p id="5268f8ba">                Once you're familiar with the main profiling terms, let's look at how we can work with dotMemory.            </p>        </div>    </div>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="4b1ad08e" data-toc="Getting_Started_with_dotMemory#4b1ad08e">Step 5.

The main idea here is to collect data (one or more memory snapshots) and choose a number        of suspects (<i id="fdc5696d">analysis subjects</i> that are potentially causing the issue).        So, you start with some list of suspects and gradually narrow this list down.        One suspect may lead you to another and so on, until you determine the guilty one.    </p>    <ol class="list _decimal"><li class="list__item" id="51260e80">            Please look at the left part of the dotMemory window.

As you can see, you started with            <span class="control">Profiling GameOfLife.exe</span>            (step #1), then you opened            <span class="control">Snapshot #1</span>            (step #2) and asked            dotMemory to show you all objects in the heap (object set <span class="control">All objects</span>).            As even a tiny app creates numerous objects, the attempt to analyze each object separately will not be very            effective. That is why the main subject of your analysis in dotMemory is the so-called            <span class="emphasis">object set</span>.            <figure><img alt="basic concepts 4" title="basic concepts 4" src="/help/img/dotnet/2019.2/basic_concepts_4.png" id="80cbd4d9" width="773" height="398"></figure>            <span class="emphasis">Object set</span>            is a number of objects selected by a specific condition. For ease of understanding, think of an            object set as of a result of some query* (very similar to an SQL query). For example, you can tell dotMemory            something like "<i id="0e10844a">Select all objects created by SomeCall() and promoted to Gen 2</i>",            or "<i id="4f987c61">Select all objects retained in memory by the instance A</i>", and so on.            <aside class="note " data-title="" rel="4f987c61" id="7d9c5f9d"><p>* Of course, you do not actually type any queries.

Look at the screen.            The view you see is called <span class="control">Group by Types</span> and it shows you a plain list of objects in the set            grouped by their type.            Other views can reveal other info about the selected set. For example, the            <span class="control">Group by Dominators</span>            view will            show you who retains the selected objects in memory; <span class="control">Call Tree</span>            will show you what calls created the objects; and so on. You can easily change the view using the buttons            at the top of the screen:            <figure><img alt="tutorial1 views" title="tutorial1 views" src="/help/img/dotnet/2019.2/tutorial1_views.png" id="3072cac6" width="667" height="62"></figure>            As mentioned above, each subject you analysis may lead you to another subject. For example, we see that the            <code class="code">System.Windows.Shapes.Ellipse</code>            class retains most of the memory, and we want to know what method created all these ellipses.            Let's find this out.        </p></li><li class="list__item" id="556f5023"><p>            Double-click <span class="control">System.Windows.Shapes.Ellipse</span> or open the context menu            (with the right click) for these objects and select            <span class="control">Open this object set</span>.        </p></li><li class="list__item" id="8bc19b6d"><p>            Select <span class="control">Back Traces</span> view.            <figure><img alt="tutorial1 call tree" title="tutorial1 call tree" src="/help/img/dotnet/2019.2/tutorial1_call_tree.png" id="c4fb7333" width="800" height="533"></figure>            The view shows that our ellipses originate from the <code class="code">Grid.InitCellsVisuals()</code> method.
