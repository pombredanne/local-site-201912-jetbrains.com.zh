It is only about giving you a feel of one of the possible workflows.    </p></aside>    <p id="6ba1f72e">        In this tutorial, we'll see how you can use dotMemory to locate and fix memory leaks in your apps. But before        moving on, let's agree on what a memory leak is.    </p>    <div class="chapter"><h3 id="8165a399" data-toc="How_to_Find_a_Memory_Leak#8165a399">What is a memory leak?</h3>        <p id="000c65c3">            According to the most popular definition, a memory leak is a result of incorrect memory management when "an object is stored            in            memory but cannot be accessed by the running code." In addition, "memory leaks add up over time, and if they            are            not cleaned up, the system eventually runs out of memory."        </p>        <p id="6938ba91">            Actually, if we'll strictly follow the definition above, "classic" memory leaks are not possible in .NET apps.            Garbage Collector (GC) fully controls memory release and removes all objects that cannot be accessed by the            code.            Moreover, after the app is closed, GC entirely frees the memory occupied by the app. Nevertheless, point #2            (memory            exhaustion because of a leak) is quite real. Of course, this won't crash the system, but sooner or later the            app            will raise            an <code class="code">OutOfMemory</code> exception.        </p>        <p id="90f119b0">            Why can this happen? The thing is, GC collects only            <a href="Getting_Started_with_dotMemory.html#app-roots">unreferenced objects</a>.            If there's a reference to an object you don't know about, GC won't collect the object.            Therefore, the main tactic in fixing memory leaks is to determine            objects that add up over time (causing the leaks) as well as the objects that retain the former ones in            memory.        </p>        <p id="5f3e1b8a">            Let's try this tactic for fixing a leak in our sample application.        </p>    </div>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="aa00f5c4" data-toc="How_to_Find_a_Memory_Leak#aa00f5c4">Sample application</h2>        <p id="5c70b187">            Once again, the app we'll use for our tutorial is Conway's Game of Life. Please download the application            from            <a href="https://github.com/DarthWeirdo/GoL_dotMemory_Tutorial2" data-external="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github</a>            before proceeding any further.            Let's assume we want to return some money spent on the Game of Life development and decide to add a            window that show various ads to users. Following worst practices, we show our ad window every time a user            starts Game of Life (clicks the <span class="control">Start</span> button). When a user clicks a banner, he/she is            redirected to some website and the ad window is closed (the user may also close the window using the            standard            close button, though            that's not what we really want). To change ads, the ad window uses a timer (based on the            <span class="control">DispatcherTimer</span>            class).            You can see the implementation of the <span class="control">AdWindow</span> class in the            <span class="filepath">AdWindow.cs</span>            file.            <figure><img alt="t2 gol app" title="t2 gol app" src="/help/img/dotnet/2019.2/t2_gol_app.png" id="bb3376d1" width="600" height="392"></figure>            So, the feature is added and now is the best time to test it. Let's run dotMemory and ensure that the ad            window            doesn't affect the application's memory usage (in other words, it is correctly allocated and collected).        </p>    </div>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="step-1-run-the-profiler" data-toc="How_to_Find_a_Memory_Leak#step-1-run-the-profiler">Step 1.

Note that the list of possible views                for instances differs from the one of an object set.

To                figure this out, we can simply switch to the <span class="control">Key Retention Paths</span> view. This view shows                the graph of retention paths.

But why is the ad window kept in memory after we close it? The thing is that we subscribed the window to                the                timer's                event but forgot to unsubscribe it.

In fact, the code already contains                such a method, and all you need to do is uncomment the                <code class="code">Unsubscribe();</code>                line in the window's                <code class="code">OnClosed</code>                event.

It exists in the snapshot regardless of the fact that the ad                window                was closed and removed from memory. This looks like one more memory leak that we should analyze.            </p></li><li class="list__item" id="beaae48e"><p>Double-click the <code class="code">AdWindow.ctor(Window owner)</code> call.                dotMemory will show us the instance of the <code class="code">DispatcherTimer</code> class created by this call.                By default, the <span class="control">Outgoing References</span> view will be used. We, in turn, want to find                out how this instance is retained in memory.

The second way shows that the timer is also retained by the                <code class="code">DispatcherOperationCallback</code>                object.                This object is a delegate that is created when you run the timer. This means that the timer is still                running.                One peculiar thing of the                <code class="code">DispatcherTimer</code>                class is that the instance is removed from the global timer list only                after the timer is stopped.
