The server can continue issuing licenses without connecting to the JetBrains Account for up to                    48 hours from the last successful connection. Ensure that the Floating License Server connects to the JetBrains                    Account at least once every two days.

Once you install the Floating License Server and connect it to your JetBrains account,                    it can issue and revoke license tickets for client applications (JetBrains IDEs and other tools) in                    your network. Each license provides one ticket, which can be used on a single computer at a time.                </p>                <p id="453cbea0">                    When you start an IDE, it requests for a license from the Floating License Server. After verification, the server                    issues a ticket for the IDE, if there is a license available. While the product is running, it                    asks for license prolongation every 10 minutes. When you stop the IDE, its ticket is released back                    to the pool and becomes available for other clients. This model makes a product available for as                    many users at a time as the number of available licenses you have purchased for your team.                </p>            </dd><dt id="3b646282">What happens to a license if the computer to which it was issued goes into sleep mode?</dt><dd>                <p id="f546d1da">                    The license remains in use even if the machine is hibernating.
