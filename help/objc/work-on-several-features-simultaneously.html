The only difference is in the way patches are generated and applied.                Stashes are generated by Git, and can be applied from within AppCode, or outside it.                Patches with shelved changes are generated by AppCode and are also applied through the IDE.                Also, stashing involves all uncommitted changes, while when you put changes to a shelf, you can select some of the                local changes instead of shelving them all.            </p>        </li><li class="list__item" id="8daf4787"><p>            You can <a href="#changelists">keep changes related to different tasks or features in different changelists</a>.        </p></li><li class="list__item" id="e59e1086"><p>            You can create <a href="#feature-branches">branches to work on different unrelated features</a>.        </p></li></ul>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="shelve" data-toc="Work_on_several_features_simultaneously#shelve">Shelve changes</h2>        <a name="shelve-unshelve changes"></a>            <p id="8c9a9bea">                Shelving is temporarily storing pending changes you have not committed yet.
