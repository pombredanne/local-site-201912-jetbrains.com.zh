The teams organize the queue during planning sessions and revisit the priority on a regular basis.      Planning sessions occur after every major release.      The teams makes a preliminary agreement on the priority for each task and who will take it.</p>    <p id="d07a2d40">The team updates the queue when new critical issues or regressions appear, or whenever the teams just feel that the order needs to change.</p>    <p id="02aba7c6">Developers also have their own lists of things to do.      The queue is simply a guideline.

When these teams publish an EAP or release version of their product, they remove all of the issues that are included in the release from the board.      One way to clean up the <span class="control">Done</span> column is to search for all of the resolved issues that were included in the latest release, for example, <code class="code">in: CPP version: {CLion 2017.1.1} State: Fixed</code> and update them with a command.      The command to remove issues from the CLion board is <code class="code">remove Board CLion Kanban</code>.    The teams have implemented a workflow that performs this task automatically, as described below.</p>  </div>  <div class="chapter"><h2 id="workflow-support-manage-assignments">Workflow Support</h2>    <p id="d097d0c5">The CLion and AppCode teams use several workflow rules that automatically update values in issues that are managed on the board. The following workflows are triggered by events on the board:</p>    <ol class="list _decimal"><li class="list__item" id="9afe4b29"><p>When a developer changes takes an issue for analysis or development, the workflow adds the issue to the board and assigns the card to the current user.        This workflow also assigns a card to the QA Engineer who moves it to the <span class="control">Test</span> column.        The assignee is not updated when cards move between other columns — these assignments are set manually.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="4e477eb0"><p>When an issue is added to the board, the value in the <span class="control">Kanban Track</span> field is set to <span class="control">General</span> (if the field was empty).        This workflow fires when a developer adds an issue to the board with a command or by setting a value of the <span class="control">Kanban State</span> field in the issue itself.        This ensures that the issue is added to the correct swimlane.        If the value in the <span class="control">Kanban Track</span> field is empty, the card appears in the swimlane for uncategorized cards, which is not where it belongs.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="74ef398c"><p>When a card moves to the <span class="control">Test</span> column, the <span class="control">no testing</span> tag is removed from the issue.        The team uses the no testing tag to flag trivial fixes.        The developer and reviewer can agree that an issue doesn't require testing and add the tag.        However, if QA disagrees and decides it should be tested, the tag is removed automatically.        When QA agrees to pass the issue without testing, the tag remains as an indicator that the fix was not tested manually.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="202bf703"><p id="e474af97">When a card is moved from one column to another, changes are synchronized with the value that is stored in the <span class="control">State</span> field.        The <span class="control">Kanban State</span> field stores values as enumerated types, not states.        If the value for the <span class="control">State</span> field is not synchronized with changes on the board, the issues are never moved to a state that is considered to be resolved.        This workflow sets the value for the <span class="control">State</span> when the following changes are applied to an issue:</p>      <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="57e747ff"><p>When a card moves to the <span class="control">Done</span> column, the state is set to <span class="control">Fixed</span>.          The issue is then considered to be resolved.          If the card is currently assigned to the <span class="control">Priority</span> swimlane, it moves to <span class="control">General</span>.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="821136ff"><p>When a card is added to the board (meaning the <span class="control">Kanban State</span> field is set to any value other than <span class="control">Done</span>), the state is set to <span class="control">In Progress</span>.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="621a80e0"><p>If an issue is removed from the board (meaning the <span class="control">Kanban State</span> field is set to an empty value) and an issue has the <span class="control">In Progress</span> state, the state is set to <span class="control">Open</span>.
