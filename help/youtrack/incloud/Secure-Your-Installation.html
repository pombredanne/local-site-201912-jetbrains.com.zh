Permissions are assigned to a collection of roles, which are then granted to users and groups for a specific project.            Users only have permission to perform the operations that are allowed for the role that they are assigned in each project.</p>        <p id="98ccedaf">If you are overly-generous with granting permissions, you expose your system to high risk from insider threats.            It also gives external hackers access to sensitive data as soon as any of your accounts is compromised.</p>        <p id="463e8951">We recommend that you follow the principle of least privilege and only grant access to the information and resources that are absolutely necessary to perform the operations that are required for each user.
