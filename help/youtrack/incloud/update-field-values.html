These fields store values that convey basic information and help to sort issues into a variety of categories.        The basic behavior of each field is defined by the type of data that it stores.        For example:</p>        <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="47b789c6"><p>Fields that store dates or dates and times let you pick dates from a calendar.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="f68bc9f3"><p>Fields that store enumerated values let you select one or more values from a list.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="98f218f2"><p>Fields that store simple types like strings and integers let you enter the value directly in the field.</p></li></ul>        <p id="933fef49">Project administrators can also tune the behavior of these fields.                These settings can vary from project to project.                As a result, you can experience a wide range of options when you set and update values for different fields in an issue.        Use the information on this page to familiarize yourself with each of these options.</p>        <div class="chapter"><h2 id="supplemental-text-fields" data-toc="update-field-values#supplemental-text-fields">Supplemental Text Fields</h2>                <p id="8ebdd7a2">YouTrack supports custom fields that store values as text.

User mentions in text fields are replaced with the user's full name and set as a link, but don't trigger notifications as they do when added to an issue description or comment.

For example, projects that use the TeamCity integration assign build numbers to issues when a commit message that is processed by the integration mentions an issue.                        Build numbers in YouTrack are appended with an icon that provides direct access to the build in TeamCity.</p>                <p id="8babebbb">If you manually assign a build number that has been processed by the integration to a field, the TeamCity icon is added to this field as well.</p>                <figure><a class="lightbox" href="/help/img/youtrack/2019.2/build-field-values.zoomed.png"><img alt="set values for build fields" title="set values for build fields" src="/help/img/youtrack/2019.2/build-field-values.png" id="cee93e31" width="600" height="265"></a></figure>                <p id="42b058ac">For more information, see <a href="configure-build-server-integration-per-project.html">Integrate with a Build Server</a>.</p>        </div>        <div class="chapter"><h2 id="add-new-value-to-field" data-toc="update-field-values#add-new-value-to-field">Adding New Values to Fields</h2>        <p id="42f019bf">Each project can have a distinct set of values that are stored in custom fields that store enumerated values.
