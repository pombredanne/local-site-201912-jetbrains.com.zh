Each issue has the potential to contain a wealth of information that, when lost, cannot be recovered easily.    In general, we recommend that you avoid deleting issues whenever possible.    Here are a few alternatives to deleting issues:</p>    <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="f2b39030"><p>If the issue duplicates an existing issue, link it to the existing issue as a duplicate.        In this case, the value for the <span class="control">State</span> field is set to <span class="control">Duplicate</span>, which is a resolved state.        The issue is excluded from search results for unresolved issues, but any information contained in the issue is retained.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="2f21ed37"><p>If the issue is no longer relevant and you don't want anyone to waste time working on it, select an appropriate value for the <span class="control">State</span> field to resolve the issue.        Default states like <span class="control">Can't Reproduce</span>, <span class="control">Won't fix</span>, <span class="control">Incomplete</span>, and <span class="control">Obsolete</span> indicate that the issue does not require additional effort.        This helps to explain why an issue should not fixed without deleting it from the system.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="02114d39"><p>If you created an issue in the wrong project, don't delete it and create another.        Simply update the value in the <span class="control">Project</span> field.</p></li></ul>    <p id="64c87bea">The best reason that you might have for deleting an issue is because you created it by mistake.    If you're confident that an issue that you created is unnecessary, you should be able to delete it without disrupting anyone else's work.    Just don't assume that this rule applies to issues that were created by other users.</p>    <section class="procedure-steps"><h3 id="delete-single-issue">To delete a single issue:</h3><aside data-type="tip" class="prompt" data-title="" rel="delete-single-issue" id="cc7bff6a"><p>Requires permissions: Read Issue, Delete Issue</p></aside><ol class="list _decimal"><li class="list__item" id="71ecd6ff"><p>Open an issue in single issue view.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="f9b2d1e6"><p>Click the <span class="control">Delete</span> icon in the toolbar.        <figure><a class="lightbox" href="/help/img/youtrack/2019.2/delete-issue.zoomed.png"><img alt="Delete issue" title="Delete issue" src="/help/img/youtrack/2019.2/delete-issue.png" id="ad5e78f3" width="600" height="247"></a></figure>        </p></li><li class="list__item" id="5ec9c033"><p id="1b8a0327">Click the <span class="control">Delete</span> button in the dialog to confirm the action.</p>        <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="15938e55"><p>The issue is deleted from YouTrack.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="4dc7e021"><p>The action cannot be undone.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="d567bd9a"><p>To restore the issue, you have to restore a backup copy that contains the issue and import the issue from the backup to your YouTrack database.

If you want to delete a batch of issues, you can delete them permanently and reduce the size of your database.</p>        <p id="39a0f127">To delete issues permanently, you need to remove the project that they belong to from YouTrack.            This action is mostly used to delete old projects that you no longer use.        For instructions, see <a href="remove-project.html">Remove a Project</a>.</p>            <p id="1839a309">If you want to delete older issues, but still want to keep the project open, use this workaround:</p>        <aside data-type="tip" class="prompt" data-title="" rel="1839a309" id="c2fa784d"><p>Requires permissions: Create Project, Read Issue, Update Issue, Delete Project</p></aside>        <ol class="list _decimal"><li class="list__item" id="df82c805"><p>Create a new project.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="129828d6"><p>Use a search query that returns all of the issues that you want to delete.

In YouTrack, this permission is granted to the default <span class="control">Developer</span> role.        This means that any member of the project team can delete any issue in the project.</p>        <p id="c0f0e8e4">For some organizations, this scheme can be too permissive.        If you find that users are deleting issues when they shouldn't be doing so and a stern warning or two doesn't discourage this behavior, consider one or more of the following alternatives.            These modifications can be made by a system administrator or another user with the <span class="control">Create Role</span> or <span class="control">Update Role</span> permission.</p>        <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="c8bd2f29"><p>Remove the <span class="control">Delete Issue</span> permission from the default <span class="control">Developer</span> role.

This gives project administrators the ability to decide whether the members of their project teams can be trusted with issue deletion or not.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="0970ad34"><p>Create a custom role that includes only the <span class="control">Delete Issue</span> permission.
