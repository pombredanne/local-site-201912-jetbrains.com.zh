Previously, commercial subscriptions only let you pre-pay for a fixed number of users.</p>        <p id="ce1cc909">With this subscription model, we also offer a new free plan for up to three users that includes support for private projects.        The old free plan supported up to 10 users, but all of your projects were public.</p>        <p id="8623443a">If your YouTrack InCloud instance was registered prior to the introduction of this pricing model, you have the option to switch to the new model.        You have no obligation to switch.                We continue to support the current plans for existing customers.                If you're happy with your current subscription or want to continue using the 10-user free plan with public projects, you can stick with your current license.               You can extend your subscription for your current plan as long as you wish.</p>        <p id="7d089683">The following changes are not supported:</p>        <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="c59eae69"><p>You can't switch your current plan to another old plan.                If you want to switch to a license that supports a different number of users, you need to migrate to the new per-user pricing model.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="e8a9a20f"><p>If you switch your license to the new model, you can't switch back to your old plan.                The old plans are not available for newly registered instances and are no longer offered as an option for upgrades.</p></li></ul>        <p id="ffa0f649">You can manage subscriptions for active instances on the <a href="https://account.jetbrains.com/licenses" data-external="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Licenses</a> page in your JetBrains Account.</p>        <div class="chapter"><h2 id="switch-to-new-commercial-subscription" data-toc="switching-subscription-plans#switch-to-new-commercial-subscription">Switching to a New Commercial Subscription</h2>                <p id="fbae46c3">For YouTrack InCloud instances that use a commercial license, you can switch to the new pricing model at any time.                The unused amount that you have pre-paid for your current subscription is subtracted from the price for the new subscription plan.</p>                <p id="4099b5ff">There is a restriction that applies if you want to switch your annual subscription (old or new) to a monthly billing cycle.                If you have a commercial license that is billed annually and want to switch to monthly billing, you need to wait for your current subscription to expire.                We don't have a mechanism in place that stores credit for unused prepayments over multiple billing cycles.                We added this restriction to make sure that you don't lose what you've already paid for.</p>                <p id="6ed51ddc">If you're currently using the free plan or trial subscription, you can also switch to the per-user model whenever you like.</p>                <p id="9a31f557">You can access options for upgrading your current subscription directly on the <span class="control">Global Settings</span> page of your YouTrack InCloud instance.</p>                <figure><a class="lightbox" href="/help/img/youtrack/2019.2/upgrade-subscription.zoomed.png"><img alt="upgrade subscription" title="upgrade subscription" src="/help/img/youtrack/2019.2/upgrade-subscription.png" id="ead883d8" width="600" height="149"></a></figure>                <p id="db55bf08">When you click the <span class="control">Upgrade your subscription</span> button, you are authorized in the JetBrains eStore go directly to the page that shows possible upgrade options for your instance.</p>        </div>        <div class="chapter"><h2 id="switch-to-free-plan" data-toc="switching-subscription-plans#switch-to-free-plan">Switching to the New Free Plan</h2>                <p id="67f8e3ae">For YouTrack InCloud instances that use the free plan for 10 users, you can switch to the new free plan.
