As a result, you don't need to revoke roles from the <span class="control">Global</span> project to make your projects private.</p>        <p id="75196664">In older installations, the guest user is granted the <span class="control">Observer</span> role in the <span class="control">Global</span> project.        The default <span class="control">Observer</span> role has been modified to exclude access to issues in projects.            However, an administrator may have granted access to the guest user beyond the default role assignments.</p>            <p id="53b81cb2">To restrict project access exclusively to members of the project team and other users or groups who are assigned direct roles in the project,            you'll need help from a system administrator.

A system administrator can remove roles that are assigned to the guest account in the <span class="control">Global</span> project.                Project administrators can then allow guest access on a per-project basis.

It's common practice to assign roles to users and groups in the <span class="control">Global</span> project to ensure that a handful of users can perform similar duties in all projects.                You can check the set of permissions that are granted by these roles on the <span class="control">Access</span> tab in your project.                If you find that a particular role assignment in the <span class="control">Global</span> project exposes a greater level of access than is required, discuss the setup with a system administrator.                A system administrator can either update the permissions that are assigned to the role or revoke this level of access at the global level.</p></li></ul>    </div><div class="last-modified" data-skip-index="skip">Last modified: 29 November 2019 </div><div data-feedback-placeholder="true"></div><div class="navigation-links _bottom" data-skip-index="skip"><a class="navigation-links__prev" href="custom-project-templates.html">Custom Project Templates</a><a class="navigation-links__next" href="Time-Management-Tutorial.html">Time Tracking Tutorial</a></div></article><div id="disqus_thread" data-skip-index="skip"></div></div></section></main></div><script src="//resources.jetbrains.com/storage/help-app/v3/app.js"></script></body></html>
