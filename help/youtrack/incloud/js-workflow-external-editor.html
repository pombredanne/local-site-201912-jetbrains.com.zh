With this setup, you can safely update your workflows while working exclusively in your favorite development environment.</p>        <p id="6b40f8bd">If there are other developers in your organization who write scripts for their own projects, you might want to get everyone to work together.            Follow the instructions in the next section and share this setup with your team.</p>    </div>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="working-as-team-workflows" data-toc="js-workflow-external-editor#working-as-team-workflows">Working as a Team</h2>        <p id="c2d1293a">One of the biggest advantages of the setup in this section is that supports collaboration.            With a few modifications, you can build a platform that other developers can use to manage workflows in your YouTrack installation.            As this setup is not specific to any single environment, these developers can be working with any IDE that supports JavaScript in any operating system.</p>        <p id="879ae507">The first thing you can do is modify your <code class="code">package.json</code> file.            Each of the developers who work with this setup will need to generate and store their own personal tokens, but the variables that are used for the host are the same for everybody.</p>        <p id="64d6d8ba">To streamline the setup for other users, you can pull these variables into the <code class="code">package.json</code> file and update the references in your scripts. Use the following example as a guide.</p>        <div class="code-block" data-lang="json">{
