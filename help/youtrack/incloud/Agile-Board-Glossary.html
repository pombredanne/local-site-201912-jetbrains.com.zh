In other words, it is the collection of unfinished work that your development team can build to improve the product.                Teams normally prioritize issues in the backlog to determine which issues are addressed in each release cycle.</p>                <p id="02db8d32">In YouTrack, the collection of issues that are displayed in the backlog on an agile board is represented by a saved search.

This swimlane shows orphan tasks, but can also show issues with parent tasks when the parent task is not used to identify a swimlane on the board.</p></td></tr><tr id="7a769704" class="ijRowEven"><td id="a1e94979"><p>orphans swimlane</p></td><td id="bc672df7"><p id="cadf5104">The <i id="916e33a1">orphans swimlane</i> in YouTrack is shown as dedicated swimlane for uncategorized cards.                This swimlane shows all cards that are assigned to the sprint or board that do not belong to any swimlane.                These can be true orphans that do not have a parent task, or subtasks of parent issues that are not shown as swimlanes in the current view.</p>                <p id="015d2e73">The location of the swimlane for uncategorized cards is managed in the board settings.

The completed effort results in a viable version of the product that can be delivered to the consumer.</p>                <p id="0d52e123">In YouTrack, there are three methods that you can use to add issues to sprints:</p>                <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="23cd9f42"><p>You can manually assign issues to sprints by creating them on the board or dragging them from the backlog.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="f0b9b14d"><p>You can automatically assign issues to a default sprint.
