Many hardware security keys are designed to be plugged into a USB 3.x port, which most mobile devices don't have.            If you secure your account with this type of device in the browser on your desktop machine, you will probably need to use an adapter to authenticate with this device on your mobile devices.            Here are a few alternatives that you might use to authenticate on both desktop and mobile:</p>        <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="2509e3fe"><p>Use a security key that connects to a USB-C port.                While this type of connection is widely supported by both desktop and mobile devices, some devices may still require an adapter.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="6d297593"><p>Use a security key that supports near-field communication (NFC).                These keys can usually be plugged into the USB port on your desktop computer and connect to a mobile device over NFC.                To pair the security key with your account on a mobile device, the mobile device must support NFC as well.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="55cc5f6a"><p>Use a security key that supports a Bluetooth connection.                These keys can pair with both desktop and mobile clients that support this standard.</p></li></ul>                <p id="60d0a271">Keep in mind that you only need to provide a second authentication factor on your mobile device when you work with YouTrack in a mobile browser.            If you're only working with YouTrack, you can download and install YouTrack Mobile and authenticate with an application password instead.

A user with the <span class="control">Update User</span> permission can access your profile and disable two-factor authentication for you.            You can then log in with just your login and password.
