You can restrict read access for an issue within the scope that is set at the project level.

While it is possible set the visibility of an issue to another group, for example, group C,            the members of this group do not have access permissions in the project and cannot view the issue.</p>        <p id="388186b9">Issues with visibility restrictions display a padlock icon.
