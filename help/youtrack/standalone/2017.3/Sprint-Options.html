This minor change in the board settings opens up some big changes in board behavior.</p>    <p id="f45c7b2f">The <span class="control">Board behavior</span> settings define how issues are added to the board.        There are different sets of options for boards with sprints and boards without sprints.        This page explains how each option affects the behavior of your board.</p>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="agile-board-with-sprints" data-toc="Sprint-Options#agile-board-with-sprints">Options for Boards with Sprints</h2>        <p id="93ca61db">With sprints enabled, an additional dimension is added to your board.            You have a series of sprints that can be assigned a duration in time.            Each issue is assigned not only to the board, but also to a specific sprint.            The board only displays issues that are assigned to the selected sprint.            Switching between sprints displays a different set of issues.</p>        <p id="c723339d">The board behavior options that are available for boards with sprints determine how issues are added to each sprint.</p>        <figure><img alt="sprintOptions" title="sprintOptions" src="/help/img/youtrack/2017.3/sprintOptions.png" id="8e445c27" width="927" height="259"></figure>        <div class="chapter"><h3 id="manually-assign-issues">Manually Assign Issues</h3>            <p id="e3c439a8">This is the default option for new boards.                To add an issue to the board, you must explicitly assign it to a sprint.                You can either apply a command (<code class="code" data-lang="Java">Board &lt;board name&gt; &lt;sprint name&gt;</code>), drag an existing issue from the backlog to the sprint, or add an issue directly on the board.</p>            <p id="31a8bd35">This option gives you the most control over which issues are assigned to each sprint.</p>            <p id="143f1d2b">The two remaining options let you add issues to sprints automatically under certain conditions, however, you can still add issues manually to any sprint no matter which option you choose.</p>        </div>        <div class="chapter"><h3 id="add-new-to-sprint">Automatically Add New Issues to Sprint</h3>            <p id="8e8d2b65">With this option enabled, new issues are added to the selected sprint automatically.                Issues are added automatically when:</p>            <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="6ff5e007"><p>The issue is assigned to a project that is managed on the board.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="ba72bebc"><p>The value that is set in the custom field that identifies columns matches a column that is visible on the board.</p></li></ul>            <p id="920926fb">Every time you schedule a new sprint, the option to update this setting is visible in the <span class="control">New Sprint</span> dialog.</p>            <p id="6f4a6cab">Teams that follow the Scrum development framework usually commit to the issues that they want to finish at the beginning of each sprint.                Adding issues to the sprint automatically can add work that is outside the scope of the current sprint and defeats the purpose of sprint planning.</p>            <p id="cee7d927">Many teams use this option to assign issues to an unscheduled sprint that is used for planning.                All of the issues that are created in the projects are then visible on the board without having to check the backlog.                These teams review issues that have been added to the unscheduled sprint and assign them to scheduled sprints for implementation.</p>        </div>        <div class="chapter"><h3 id="link-sprints-new">Link Sprints to Values for Custom Field</h3>            <p id="c4c1f6ed">This option lets teams that synchronize their fix versions with sprints continue to use older boards without changing their working process.                You can also use this option to link sprints to custom fields that store any enumerated type, including fields that store a <code class="code" data-lang="Java">build</code>, <code class="code" data-lang="Java">state</code>, <code class="code" data-lang="Java">version</code>, <code class="code" data-lang="Java">ownedField</code>, or <code class="code" data-lang="Java">enum</code>.</p>            <p id="f02fc6d3">With this option enabled, the board mimics the behavior of boards in YouTrack versions earlier than 7.0, where sprints were linked to fix versions.                The sprint name is linked to the set of values in the selected custom field.</p>            <p id="19836f9c">When you enable this option, YouTrack performs the following operation:</p>            <aside class="warning " data-title="" rel="19836f9c" id="276692f8">                <p id="afd12611">This operation can take some time and cannot be undone.
