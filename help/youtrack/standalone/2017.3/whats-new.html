This means that the feature is available for general use and does not need to be enabled separately.<br><br>                    You can write workflows in JavaScript instead of the domain-specific language that is used in the previous versions.                    Write a workflow in any IDE that supports JavaScript, pack it into a ZIP file and upload it to YouTrack.<br><br>                    In addition, we've built a web-based workflow editor inside YouTrack. Here, you can write a workflow from scratch without leaving YouTrack.<br><br>                    Weâ€™ve added support for action rules.                    This type of script lets you extend YouTrack with actions that can be applied as commands or accessed directly from the issue toolbar.                    The new workflows also support custom scripts, which let you better organize and structure your code. Define your own functions and objects and use them in other rules and workflows.<br><br>                    We still support workflows that were written in the external workflow editor.                    However, if you want to apply changes to old workflows, we recommend that you rewrite them in JavaScript.</p></td><td id="ffe50676"><p>2017.3</p></td></tr><tr id="8e6c020c" class="ijRowEven"><td id="2060a7c4"><a href="New-board-FAQ.html#no-sprints">Improved Kanban Support</a></td><td id="c9e04473"><p>We have added an option on agile boards to disable sprints completely.

You can track your progress on these issues privately without adding unnecessary distractions for other members of your project team.<br><br>            We've also added a special permission that lets privileged users view issues, comments, and attachments with visibility restrictions.
