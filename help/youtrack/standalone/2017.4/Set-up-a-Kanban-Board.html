Your process can include many stages, and all of them are visualized on the board. Most development teams use three to seven columns.            This is a reasonable limit, as monitoring the board is essential in Kanban practice. The more columns you have, the harder they are to track.</p>        <p id="75ce6546">Columns usually represent the development stage, department name, or anything else that you consider to be a stage in your work.            When you create a new card on the Kanban board, the card represents an issue in YouTrack.            One of the issue fields stores the stage. By default, the board uses a field that stores this value as a <code class="code" data-lang="Java">state</code> type.            When you move the card around the board, the field takes the value of the column that it has been moved to.</p>        <figure><img alt="kanban tutorial project config" title="kanban tutorial project config" src="/help/img/youtrack/2017.4/kanban_tutorial_project_config.png" id="255162fa" width="1281" height="696"></figure>        <p id="b015e131">This example shows a state-type field that represents the development stages for issues in the project.            The field cannot be empty, which means that all new issues that are created in this project is displayed in the column that represents this value on the board when it is set.</p>        <p id="b7f1b83d">For best results, edit the set of values for an existing field that uses a state type.        If you add a new state-type field to your projects, be sure to remove any additional state-type fields.        Projects that use multiple state-type fields can be difficult to work with and require additional setup.
