Tasks are represented on the Gantt chart by a bar. The length of the bar represents the duration of the task.        The duration is either the estimated time required to complete the task or the actual amount of time spent — whichever is greater.        Each issue is assigned a start date based on the report start date and the duration that is assigned to predecessor tasks.</p>    <p id="5b607f97">The Gantt chart uses the standard <span class="control">finish-to-start</span> dependency relationship.        This means that predecessor tasks and subtasks must be finished before work can begin on tasks with dependency links.        Subtasks show a <span class="control">start-to-start</span> dependency relationship with other subtasks that do not have dependency links.</p>    <p id="646188f7">The report supports capacity limitations.        This option lets you measure how much time is required to finish all of the estimated tasks with a set number of resources.    You can use this setting to judge whether you can finish your tasks on time with your current resources and measure how much faster you can complete these tasks when you add resources to the team.</p>    <p id="7e5237d4">When the report is calculated, the start date, end date, and total number of working days are displayed at the top of the page.        For charts with unlimited capacity, you can toggle the presentation to show the actual or estimated duration for each task on the chart.    On charts with limited capacity, you can display the estimated view when you remove the spent time field from the report settings.</p>    <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="202f0490"><p>The <span class="control">Estimated</span> view shows how much time was estimated for each task.

This value is subtracted from the estimated duration.                    If there are no dependencies between subtasks, the largest amount of spent time in a single subtask is subtracted from the estimated duration.                    The negative number that is returned by the calculation is displayed as a positive number on the chart.                    <p id="556ddea6">For an example, see <a href="#sample-calculations">Sample Calculations</a>.</p></td></tr><tr id="d3f803f6" class="ijRowEven"><td id="382300cb"><p>estimated effort</p></td><td id="4d58c1f1"><p>The sum of the estimation for each subtask.
