The Hub authentication module has settings that let you apply rate limits to logins and requests to verify credentials.        Rate limits are applied per IP address.        Rate limits help slow down brute-force attacks by blocking new login requests for a short time following a series of consecutive login failures, so they keep your passwords safe.</p>        <p id="c4897e2d">These rate limits are only applied to logins that are processed by the Hub authentication module. Logins from third-party authentication providers are subject to their own rate limitations.</p>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="how-throttling-works" data-toc="Throttle-Failed-Logins#how-throttling-works">How Throttling Works</h2>                <p id="52422656">The default throttling settings are tuned to discourage attackers without blocking users with valid logins.

To protect the security of your installation, the default values for these settings are undisclosed.</p>                    <div class="table-wrapper"><table class="                 " width="100%" id="c2d4970a"><thead><tr id="87553a2a" class="ijRowHead"><th id="d9e1ad7f" width="15%"><p>Setting</p></th><th id="79a00ed7"><p>Impact</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr id="25054b3e" class="ijRowOdd"><td id="e6b93ee6"><p>Max sources</p></td><td id="ede4f730">The module tracks failed authentication requests from a limited number of IP addresses.                    That number is large enough to block a distributed brute-force attack.                We use a finite number to avoid storing all failed requests and consuming too much memory.                    <p id="2f930691">A counter is created for each IP address that sends an invalid request.
