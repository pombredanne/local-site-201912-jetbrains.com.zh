Some even let you require the use of 2FA by every member of your organization.</p>        <p id="202b1ab5">With 2FA, users must use a secondary device to generate an authentication code, which they must then enter when they log in with their password.            This adds an extra layer of security.            Even if a password is compromised, the malicious user cannot access the application without the authentication code from the secondary device.</p>        <p id="f04b3674">When users enable 2FA, they need to enter an authentication code every time they log into YouTrack with the account that is managed in the connected service.</p>    </div>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="enforce-password-policy" data-toc="Secure-Your-Installation#enforce-password-policy">Enforce a Password Policy</h2>        <p id="939d5128">If you're using third-party services for authentication and don't require 2FA, you can't guarantee that every user sets it up.

Permissions are assigned to a collection of roles, which are then granted to users and groups for a specific project.            Users only have permission to perform the operations that are allowed for the role that they are assigned in each project.</p>        <p id="b4f407a9">If you are overly-generous with granting permissions, you expose your system to high risk from insider threats.            It also gives external hackers access to sensitive data as soon as any of your accounts is compromised.</p>        <p id="9f141e45">We recommend that you follow the principle of least privilege and only grant access to the information and resources that are absolutely necessary to perform the operations that are required for each user.

However, if your organization uses security information and event management software, a much better solution is to include your YouTrack log files as a data source.            These solutions let you scan and analyze aggregated log files and generate alerts when a suspicious pattern of activity is detected.</p>        <p id="b1ac9926">Follow these guidelines to secure your log files:</p>        <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="2a81e97b"><p>Ensure that only individuals who have a job-related need have access to the data directory where you store your YouTrack log files.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="ba5573ae"><p>Create backup copies of your YouTrack log files on a centralized log server.</p></li></ul>    </div>                <div class="chapter"><h2 id="limit-access-sensitive-information" data-toc="Secure-Your-Installation#limit-access-sensitive-information">Limit Access to Sensitive Information</h2>        <p id="e7aa0cc9">If you store sensitive information in your issues, take extra efforts to make sure this data is secure.</p>        <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="bdf71812"><p>Use dedicated projects to store issues that contain information that can be used to identify a person.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="b3958528"><p>Make sure the users who have access to issues in this project understand the sensitivity of this information.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="dbd9515b"><p>Restrict project access to the users who need to view and use this information.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="9256809c"><p>Restrict the visibility of issues and comments to the group of users who have access to the project.</p></li></ul>        <p id="1eaa38f4">For issues that contain sensitive or confidential information, don't leave anything to chance.
