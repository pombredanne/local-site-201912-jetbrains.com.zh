Your process can include many stages, and all of them are visualized on the board. Most development teams use three to seven columns.            This is a reasonable limit, as monitoring the board is essential in Kanban practice. The more columns you have, the harder they are to track.</p>        <p id="c21dfd6d">Columns usually represent the development stage, department name, or anything else that you consider to be a stage in your work.            When you create a new card on the Kanban board, the card represents an issue in YouTrack.            One of the issue fields stores the stage. By default, the board uses a field that stores this value as a <code class="code" data-lang="Java">state</code> type.            When you move the card around the board, the field takes the value of the column that it has been moved to.</p>        <figure><img alt="kanban tutorial project config" title="kanban tutorial project config" src="/help/img/youtrack/2017.2/kanban_tutorial_project_config.png" id="6183f384" width="1281" height="696"></figure>        <p id="8b497326">This example shows a state-type field that represents the development stages for issues in the project.            The field cannot be empty, which means that all new issues that are created in this project is displayed in the column that represents this value on the board when it is set.</p>        <p id="57551a3c">For best results, edit the set of values for an existing field that uses a state type.        If you add a new state-type field to your projects, be sure to remove any additional state-type fields.        Projects that use multiple state-type fields can be difficult to work with and require additional setup.

The Kanban method doesn't require them, so you don't need to create sprints for your Kanban board.</p>            <p id="c1971a2d">When you use the board to reflect a continuous work flow, there are no scheduled iterations.                To highlight this concept, you may want to update the default name that is assigned to the first sprint and use something more generic.</p>            <figure><img alt="kanban tutorial sprints" title="kanban tutorial sprints" src="/help/img/youtrack/2017.2/kanban_tutorial_sprints.png" id="6c0016f1" width="1282" height="321"></figure>            <p id="08ff26ea">You can use sprints to clear the board on a periodic basis.            As your team works to resolve issues, you can accumulate a large number of cards in the final stage of delivery.            You can create sprints that represent arbitrary, unscheduled intervals and move all of the unresolved issues to the new sprint.            When you use the Kanban method to develop a specific version of a product, you can create unscheduled sprints for each development cycle.</p>            <p id="13a48529">You can also create sprints to track changes in your development process.            Any time you implement a change, create a new sprint to measure the impact of your new process compared to the previous iteration.</p>        </div>        <div class="chapter"><h3 id="99966d65">Adding Cards to the Board</h3>            <p id="5e73e9d9">A common practice in Kanban is to add work items to the board in a column that represents an open state.            You can add issues as cards directly on the board.            If you have a backlog of issues that you want to manage on this board, you can open the backlog and pull the issues from the backlog to the board.</p>            <p id="d4c6dead">For the setup that is described in this tutorial, the field that is used to define columns cannot be empty.            All issues that are created in the projects that are managed on the board are created directly on the board.</p>        </div>        <div class="chapter"><h3 id="c0ee19de">Moving Cards Around the Board</h3>            <a name="Moving_tasks_around_the_board"></a>            <p id="e97fe3b9">When you move cards around the board, you can exceed the maximum WIP limit for a column.                YouTrack alerts you to this condition by changing the background color of the column and indicating that the limit is exceeded.                Here you see that there are five cards in a column with a max WIP of four.</p>            <figure><img alt="kanban tutorial WIP exceeded" title="kanban tutorial WIP exceeded" src="/help/img/youtrack/2017.2/kanban_tutorial_WIP_exceeded.png" id="974d4e7a" width="1282" height="307"></figure>        </div>        <div class="chapter"><h3 id="1788e044">Card Size and TV Mode</h3>            <p id="23547e65">The slider at the top of the board sets the level of detail for cards on the board.                This setting is user-specific and can be set independently for different boards.</p>            <figure><img alt="kanban tutorial card size" title="kanban tutorial card size" src="/help/img/youtrack/2017.2/kanban_tutorial_card_size.png" id="06e75188" width="1281" height="406"></figure>            <p id="25b2429c">Some teams use large monitors or projectors to display the Kanban board at their meetings.                TV mode displays the board in full screen and uses a color scheme with a dark background.                This visual presentation has been proven to improve visibility from a distance on large monitors.</p>        </div>        <div class="chapter"><h3 id="2cf0d5e1">Progress Indicators</h3>            <a name="Progress_bar"></a>            <p id="c2f57c79">The progress indicator shows the distribution of cards by stage. Each bar corresponds to a column on the board.</p>            <p id="abfc84a4">To view the total number of cards in each column, move the pointer over the corresponding column in the progress indicator.                The number of cards in each swimlane is displayed on the right side of the swimlane.</p>            <figure><img alt="kanban tutorial progress indicators" title="kanban tutorial progress indicators" src="/help/img/youtrack/2017.2/kanban_tutorial_progress_indicators.png" id="98455679" width="1282" height="295"></figure>            <p id="d841ba70">If you have enabled the <span class="control">Estimation Field</span> setting, the board displays the total estimation for all of the cards at the top of the board.                The presentation varies based on the data type of the custom field that is used to estimate the time that is required to complete a task.</p>            <p id="181a8484">This example shows estimations in ideal days. The total estimation for all of the cards in each swimlane is displayed on the right side of the swimlane.</p>        </div>        <div class="chapter"><h3 id="506426ee">Tracking Your Progress</h3>            <a name="Cumulative_flow_diagram"></a>            <p id="b577cf82">You can open the cumulative flow diagram directly on the board.                The chart shows the distribution of cards on the board by stage for the last two weeks.            Move the pointer over a date on the chart to see the number of cards in each stage on any date that is displayed on the report.</p>            <figure><img alt="kanban tutorial cumulative flow" title="kanban tutorial cumulative flow" src="/help/img/youtrack/2017.2/kanban_tutorial_cumulative_flow.png" id="f593b268" width="1085" height="640"></figure>            <p id="05b3b96d">On this graph, the vertical axis shows the number of tasks in each column. The horizontal axis represents time by date.</p>            <p id="6ae4a733">To see how quickly you're getting things done, look at the region between <span class="control">Open</span> and <span class="control">Done</span>.                This area represents all of the intermediate stages of development.                Basically, the steeper it decreases, the faster you're completing your workload and nearing the final release date.</p>            <p id="d501bea0">Also, the intermediate stages are supposed to shrink over time. If they are expanding, it could indicate a bottleneck.                It can also mean that you're adding more work to your system than your current capacity allows.</p>        </div>    </div><div class="last-modified" data-skip-index="skip">Last modified: 7 March 2019 </div><div data-feedback-placeholder="true"></div><div class="navigation-links _bottom" data-skip-index="skip"><a class="navigation-links__prev" href="Doing-Scrum-in-YouTrack.html">Scrum Boards</a><a class="navigation-links__next" href="Manage-Epics-on-Agile-Board.html">Agile Boards for Epics</a></div></article><div id="disqus_thread" data-skip-index="skip"></div></div></section></main></div><script src="/help/app/app.js"></script></body></html>
