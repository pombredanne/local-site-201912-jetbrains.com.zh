To add an issue to the board, you must explicitly assign it to a sprint.            You can either apply a command (<code class="code" data-lang="Java">Board &lt;board name&gt; &lt;sprint name&gt;</code>), drag an existing issue from the backlog to the sprint, or add an issue directly on the board.</p>        <p id="388fa611">This option gives you the most control over which issues are assigned to each sprint.</p>        <p id="8469e90c">The two remaining options let you add issues to sprints automatically under certain conditions, however, you can still add issues manually to any sprint no matter which option you choose.</p></div>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="add-new-to-sprint" data-toc="Sprint-Options#add-new-to-sprint">Add New Issues to Sprint</h2>        <p id="27e015ec">This option was added to support the default behavior of the previous version of the board.</p>        <p id="b11c0d74">When enabled, new issues are added to the selected sprint automatically.

You can also use this option to link sprints to custom fields that store any enumerated type, including fields that store a <code class="code" data-lang="Java">build</code>, <code class="code" data-lang="Java">state</code>, <code class="code" data-lang="Java">version</code>, <code class="code" data-lang="Java">ownedField</code>, or <code class="code" data-lang="Java">enum</code>.</p>        <p id="abb0a792">With this option enabled, the board mimics the behavior of the previous version where sprints were linked to fix versions.
