However, the default permissions that are granted to this role also let reporters view and update issues that were created by other users in a project.</p>    <p id="71466da0">One of the most common access management use cases is to restrict access to users so that they can only see the issues that they reported themselves.    Issues that were reported by other users are hidden.    This type of setup is especially relevant when the issues can contain sensitive information that should only be available to a select group of authorized users.        The original reporter should still be able to view the original request and provide additional information, when needed.</p>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="issue-visibility-use-case">Use Case</h2>        <p id="74f6ba8b">To illustrate this use case, consider the following scenario.</p>        <p id="192092c1">Imagine that you have an accounting team whose members help other employees pay work-related invoices.            The team processes payments for business trips, advertising, conferences, and the like.            They use YouTrack as a means of transparent communication with other departments.            Various employees create issues that contain the details of the requested payment and a copy of the invoice.            The payment details and invoice are considered to be sensitive data.            Therefore, each issue must visible only to the reporter and the members of the accounting team.</p>    </div>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="revoke-read-issue-permission">Revoking the Read Issue Permission</h2>        <p id="70fedaf5">The key to satisfying this use case is the <span class="control">Read Issue</span> permission.</p>        <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="bbd50261"><p>The <span class="control">Read Issue</span> permission grants users the ability to view issues (public fields only) in a project.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="7e9eef69"><p>The <span class="control">Create Issue</span> permission not only lets users create issues in a project but also gives them inherent read access to the issues they create themselves.</p></li></ul>        <p id="775526e2">All you need to do is revoke the <span class="control">Read Issue</span> permission from your group of reporters.</p>        <section class="procedure-steps"><h3 id="edit-role-procedure">To apply this restriction in all projects:</h3><aside data-type="tip" class="prompt" data-title="" rel="edit-role-procedure" id="3e0d363d"><p>Requires permissions: Read Service, Read Group, Update Role</p></aside><ol class="list _decimal"><li class="list__item" id="3528cd13"><p>Revoke the <span class="control">Read Issue</span> permission from the default <span class="control">Reporter</span> role.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="8eda6b02"><p>Assign the modified <span class="control">Reporter</span> role to the <span class="control">All Users</span> group in the <span class="control">Global</span> project.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="a1f2ea23"><p>Revoke all other roles from the <span class="control">All Users</span> group.</p></li></ol></section>        <section class="procedure-steps"><h3 id="355cbdc7">To apply this restriction in specific projects:</h3><ol class="list _decimal"><li class="list__item" id="1da2c15e"><p>Check the <span class="control">All Users</span> group for roles that contain the <span class="control">Read Issue</span> permission in the <span class="control">Global</span> project.

YouTrack checks the permissions first.            If they are sufficient, it then determines whether the user is a member of any group for which the issue is visible or has been added to the <span class="control">Visible to</span> list as an individual.</p>        <p id="3ef8a51b">You can use the issue visibility settings to make users only see the issues that they reported themselves.            If permission-based visibility restrictions alone do not support your use case, consider the following alternatives:</p>        <div class="table-wrapper"><table width="100%" id="1ac51593"><thead><tr id="5d87a342" class="ijRowHead"><th id="56bbac2f" width="20%"><p>Alternative</p></th><th id="1f2a7f77"><p>Description</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr id="ab4e4c03" class="ijRowOdd"><td id="d949e5fb"><p>Update issue visibility settings manually</p></td><td id="fbc7f9fa"><p>To hide issues from other users, the reporter can change the issue visibility from <span class="control">All Users</span> to a dedicated group that excludes other reporters.                    In the use case described here, the reporter can restrict issue visibility to members of the accounting team.                    The limitation to this approach is that reporters must always remember to set issue visibility correctly.
