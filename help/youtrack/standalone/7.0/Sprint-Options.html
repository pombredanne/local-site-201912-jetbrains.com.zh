        You can also use these settings to automate how issues are added to boards with a single, unscheduled sprint.
    This page explains how each option affects the behavior of your board.</p><figure><img alt="/help/img/youtrack/7.0/sprintOptions.png" title="/help/img/youtrack/7.0/sprintOptions.png" src="/help/img/youtrack/7.0/sprintOptions.png" width="617" height="150"></figure><a name="manually-assign-issues"></a><h2>Manually Assign Issues to Sprints</h2>
        <a name="d144959e44"></a><p>This is the default option for new boards.
            To add an issue to the board, you must explicitly assign it to a sprint.
            You can either apply a command (<code class="code" data-lang="Java">Board &lt;board name&gt; &lt;sprint name&gt;</code>), drag an existing issue from the backlog to the sprint, or add an issue directly on the board.</p>
        <a name="d144959e50"></a><p>This option gives you the most control over which issues are assigned to each sprint.</p>
        <a name="d144959e53"></a><p>The two remaining options let you add issues to sprints automatically under certain conditions, however, you can still add issues manually to any sprint no matter which option you choose.</p>

<a name="add-new-to-sprint"></a><h2>Add New Issues to Sprint</h2>
        <a name="d144959e59"></a><p>This option was added to support the default behavior of the previous version of the board.</p>
        <a name="d144959e62"></a><p>When enabled, new issues are added to the selected sprint automatically.
            Issues are added automatically when:</p>
            <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item"><a name="d144959e67"></a>The issue is assigned to a project that is managed on the board.</li><li class="list__item"><a name="d144959e70"></a>The value that is set in the custom field that identifies columns matches a column that is visible on the board.</li></ul>
            <a name="d144959e74"></a><p>Every time you schedule a new sprint, the option to update this setting is visible in the <a name="d144959e76"></a><span class="control">New Sprint</span> dialog.</p>
        <a name="d144959e80"></a><p>Teams that follow the Scrum development framework usually commit to the issues that they want to finish at the beginning of each sprint.
            Adding issues to the sprint automatically can add work that is outside the scope of the current sprint and defeats the purpose of sprint planning.</p>
        <a name="d144959e84"></a><p>You can enable this setting on a Kanban board or any other board that doesn't use sprints.
        All of the issues that are created in your projects are then visible on the board without having to check the backlog.</p>

        </aside>
        <a name="d144959e98"></a><p>This option was added to let teams that synchronize their fix versions with sprints continue to use the board without changing their working process.
            You can also use this option to link sprints to custom fields that store any enumerated type, including fields that store a <code class="code" data-lang="Java">build</code>, <code class="code" data-lang="Java">state</code>, <code class="code" data-lang="Java">version</code>, <code class="code" data-lang="Java">ownedField</code>, or <code class="code" data-lang="Java">enum</code>.</p>
        <a name="d144959e116"></a><p>With this option enabled, the board mimics the behavior of the previous version where sprints were linked to fix versions.
            The sprint name is linked to the set of values in the selected custom field.</p>

        <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item"><a name="d144959e131"></a>A new sprint is created for every value in the set for the selected custom field.
                If the linked field stores a <code class="code" data-lang="Java">version</code> type, the following settings are applied to each sprint:

        <a name="d144959e164"></a><p>Once this option is enabled, actions that you perform on the board affect the value of the linked custom field, and vice versa.
            Users who update issues on the board don't require any special permissions.

            The value that is displayed in the auto-completion popup is not stored in the query &mdash; only the text-based variable.</p>

        <a name="d144959e414"></a><p>This means that a query like <code class="code" data-lang="Java">created: {this month}</code> shows issues that were created during the current month.
        As soon as the calendar changes to the next month (in this case, from November to December), any issue that was created the month prior disappears when the board is refreshed.</p>
        <a name="d144959e420"></a><p>If you use relative parameters in a query, you may experience strange behavior with:</p>
            <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item"><a name="d144959e425"></a>Live update &mdash; cards that match the filter criteria when the board is opened can disappear when the issue no longer matches the criteria after an update is applied.</li><li class="list__item"><a name="d144959e428"></a>Workflow support &mdash; workflows that react to sprint changes can apply unexpected changes.</li><li class="list__item"><a name="d144959e431"></a>Adding issue to a sprint from the backlog &mdash; issues in the backlog that do not match the parameters in the query cannot be added to the sprint.</li></ul>
        <a name="d144959e436"></a><p>You can use a board with a relative query as an alternative view to the issues list, but we don't recommend that you use this type of board to update issues.</p>
         
        <a name="d144959e440"></a><h3>Personal Queries</h3>
        <a name="d144959e442"></a><p>The value for search queries that include the keyword <code class="code" data-lang="Java">me</code> is also recalculated every time the board is opened or refreshed.
        You can use this parameter to a create one board that gives each user a view of their own issues.
        For example, a search query like <code class="code" data-lang="Java">#unresolved for: me</code> shows only unresolved issues for the currently logged-in user.
        Each member of the project team can open the board and see only the issues that are assigned to them.</p>
