The text in an issue is broken down into words. Whitespaces and punctuation are used to determine where the words begin and end.            Periods and underscores are also recognized as delimiters.</p>        </div>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="fuzzy-search" data-toc="Full-Text-Search#fuzzy-search">Fuzzy Search</h2>    <p id="72aeffa1">To find words that match an approximate pattern, instead of an exact pattern, use a fuzzy search.        Fuzzy search finds words that are just a few characters off from the word that is specified in the search query.        This technique helps you account for misspellings, partial words, and slight differences in names.</p>        <p id="38b8ba11">For example, the search query <code class="code">comments: {michael~}</code> returns issues that include not only the name <code class="code">Michael</code> in the comments but also other spellings like <code class="code">Mikhail</code>.</p>        <p id="9ce9d368">Fuzzy matching usually returns a large number of irrelevant matches            Use this option only when you know that the word you are searching for is likely to be misspelled.</p>    </div><div class="last-modified" data-skip-index="skip">Last modified: 29 November 2019 </div><div data-feedback-placeholder="true"></div><div class="navigation-links _bottom" data-skip-index="skip"><a class="navigation-links__prev" href="attribute-based-search.html">Attribute-based Search</a><a class="navigation-links__next" href="Issue-Filters.html">Filters</a></div></article><div id="disqus_thread" data-skip-index="skip"></div></div></section></main></div><script src="//resources.jetbrains.com/storage/help-app/v3/app.js"></script></body></html>
