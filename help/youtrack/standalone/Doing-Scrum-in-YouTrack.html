You work toward the final release of the product with smaller pre-releases that implement specific features.            The features are also known as <i id="61a8ff03">user stories</i>.</p>        <p id="5e9a0dc0">A product owner in Scrum negotiates a schedule for the release of the final product. Each release has to meet a deadline.            The period between the development start and the deadline is divided into smaller periods, usually two weeks to one month each.            These time-boxed efforts are called sprints.            Each sprint results in a viable pre-release version of the product.</p>    </div>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="scrum-development-youtrack" data-toc="Doing-Scrum-in-YouTrack#scrum-development-youtrack">Scrum Development with YouTrack</h2>        <a name="Scrum_approach_in_YouTrack"></a>        <p id="c05daf63">Every project in YouTrack tracks different types of issues like bug reports, feature requests, and tasks.</p>        <p id="6f88a8c9">You can view the issues in a project issues by looking at the issues in a list or displaying the issues on an agile board.            The cards on the agile board represent the same issues that are displayed in the list.            The agile board, however, gives you a better visualization of the current project state and its progress.        The board also includes a number of features that have been designed specifically to support Scrum development.</p>    </div>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="configure-scrum-project" data-toc="Doing-Scrum-in-YouTrack#configure-scrum-project">Configure Your Projects</h2>        <aside data-type="tip" class="prompt" data-title="" rel="configure-scrum-project" id="98e977a8"><p>Requires permissions: Update Project, Read Issue, Create Issue, Update Issue</p></aside>        <p id="135f6f9a">Before you start to configure your Scrum board, take a minute to pick which projects you want to manage on the board and check that they are configured properly.</p>        <p id="0d796ce0">If you want to use a Scrum board with a new project, you can create the project and two agile boards simultaneously with the Scrum project template.            For more information, see <a href="Scrum-Project-Template.html">Scrum Project Template</a>.</p>        <p id="e0ee9709">The primary agile board for Scrum development displays features (or user stories) as swimlanes on the board.            Each card on the board represents a task that contributes to the development of the corresponding feature.</p>        <p id="fa9233e1">You can also create a second board to track the progress toward the development of the final product.        This board shows epics as swimlanes, with cards that represent major features or user stories.</p>        <p id="345bc3f3">To support this configuration, all of the projects that you want to manage on a Scrum board should store these values in a custom field.        Here, we have customized the set of values that are stored in the <span class="control">Type</span> field.</p>        <figure><a class="lightbox" href="/help/img/youtrack/2019.2/scrum-tutorial-custom-fields.zoomed.png"><img alt="Scrum tutorial custom fields" title="Scrum tutorial custom fields" src="/help/img/youtrack/2019.2/scrum-tutorial-custom-fields.png" id="da7309ee" width="600" height="336"></a></figure>        <p id="855513fd">The columns on the board represent different states of delivery.            The state is also stored in an issue field. The Scrum board uses a field that stores this value as a <code class="code">state</code> type.            When you move the card around the board, the field takes the value of the column that it has been moved to.</p>        <p id="3a784338">This example shows a state-type field that represents the states of delivery in the project.            The field cannot be empty, which means that all new issues that are created in this project is displayed in the column that represents this value on the board when it is set.</p>        <figure><a class="lightbox" href="/help/img/youtrack/2019.2/scrum-tutorial-state-field.zoomed.png"><img alt="Scrum tutorial state field" title="Scrum tutorial state field" src="/help/img/youtrack/2019.2/scrum-tutorial-state-field.png" id="2ec8be04" width="600" height="336"></a></figure>        <p id="293ac8fe">For best results, edit the set of values for an existing field that uses a state type.            If you add a new state-type field to your projects, be sure to remove any additional state-type fields.            Projects that use multiple state-type fields can be difficult to work with and require additional setup.

The <span class="control">Priority</span> field has a default color scheme.            Critical issues are highlighted in pink, normal issues in green.
