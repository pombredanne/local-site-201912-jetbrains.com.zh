This report shows the total amount of time spent working on issues in one or more projects.      It displays the type of work done and the original estimation.      Time spent can be grouped by the type of work performed or by the users who performed the tasks.</p>  <p id="c28a86f2">The time report helps answer questions like:</p>  <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="da58e27a"><p>How much work was recorded last week and who performed this work?</p></li><li class="list__item" id="e2eb30a7"><p>How was the time spent allocated between different projects?</p></li><li class="list__item" id="9f676814"><p>Are the issues that are assigned to an employee usually overestimated or underestimated?</p></li></ul>  <p id="e97fc34f">However, the main problem here is that you need to analyze this data manually.    Every time you want to monitor this activity, you need to access the report, recalculate it, then analyze the data.    If you need to do any historical analysis, you have to export the data and crunch the numbers in an external tool.</p>  <div class="chapter"><h2 id="use-workflows-reporting" data-toc="generate-time-reports-workflow#use-workflows-reporting">Use Workflows as a Reporting Tool</h2>    <p id="ac84800e">While workflows don’t have direct access to calculated report data, they have access to the raw data in the form of issues and work items.      With on-schedule rules, you can report whatever you want on a regular basis and send it to someone, whether a team lead or an employee, by email.</p>    <p id="9e4ebd22">First, start with a core module that you can use to analyze issues.      This script finds all of the work items for a given assignee in a given project that were recorded within a specific time frame.      As this module is referenced in other workflow rules, save this as a separate custom script called <code class="code">work-items</code>:</p>    <div class="code-block" data-lang="javascript">var search = require('@jetbrains/youtrack-scripting-api/search');

Extract the set of values from the <span class="control">Assignee</span> field as the list of developers, get work items for each one of them, and calculate the difference between the time logged and required work duration (say, 40 hours for each developer).</p>    <p id="25e2caa8">As you may have seen in other workflows that run on a schedule, this rule uses an <i id="7dcbcaac">anchor issue</i>.      The anchor issue lets you pull the project that the issue belongs to into the context and iterate over other issues in the project.      It also makes sure the rule runs exactly once per scheduled execution.</p>    <p id="921ab8b2">For an anchor issue, just create an issue with a description like “Please don’t ever delete this issue!” and set it to a resolved state.      You can then reference its ID in the <code class="code">search</code> property of your on-schedule rule.      This makes the rule to run exactly once per each time scheduled.      You can see this technique applied in the following rules.</p>    <div class="code-block" data-lang="javascript">var entities = require('@jetbrains/youtrack-scripting-api/entities');
