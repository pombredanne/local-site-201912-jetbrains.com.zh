This version of the page is still in early stages of development.    There are several features that are supported in the current version that have not yet been implemented in the new version.    However, we will continue to update the experimental version and add support for these features as soon as they're ready.</p>  <p id="48fb74f8">By default, the feature is enabled for the <span class="control">All Users</span> group.    This means that everyone has the ability to switch to the experimental version of the page.    Users who prefer to use the current version of the page can switch back at any time.</p>  <p id="24841daa">If working with the experimental version has a negative impact on the productivity of your teams,    you can disable this feature or restrict access to specific groups on the <span class="control">Feature Configuration</span> page.    To learn how to disable an experimental feature, see <a href="Experimental-Features.html#enable-experiment">Manage Experimental Features</a>.</p>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="recent-updates" data-toc="issues-list#recent-updates">Recent Updates</h2>        <p id="d12ac6bd">As an experimental feature, we continuously deliver new functionality for the <span class="control">Issues</span> list as soon as the changes are ready.            We're listening to your feedback and updating the interface accordingly.</p>        <p id="6315bd9a">The updates described here are available in installations that are upgraded to YouTrack version 2019.1.51759 or later.</p>        <div class="chapter"><h3 id="fixed-width-custom-fields">Fixed Widths for Custom Fields</h3>            <p id="b14bbe81">In the first release, we adjusted the width for each custom field to accommodate the current value.            We thought that we could show more information for each issue and reduce the amount of whitespace by moving away from a grid layout.</p>            <p id="02c7ff14">Let's just say that few people thought that this tradeoff was worth it.            We had a lot of users complain that the ability to scan the list for information was more difficult.</p>            <p id="4a1f633b">As a result, we've gone back to assigning fixed widths to the presentation for field values.</p>            <figure><a class="lightbox" href="/help/img/youtrack/2019.1/fixed-width-fields.zoomed.png"><img alt="Issues list with fixed widths for field values" title="Issues list with fixed widths for field values" src="/help/img/youtrack/2019.1/fixed-width-fields.png" id="ecaee4cb" width="600" height="329"></a></figure>            <p id="2c96f5f5">When you filter the list to show issues from a single project or multiple projects that use the same collection of custom fields,            you'll notice that these values line up nicely in single columns.</p>            <p id="dee82fd0">We're currently working on an updated control that lets you choose which fields are shown for each issue in the list.                This will help you minimize visual clutter and align values in issues from projects with diverse field collections.

As a result, the new page was more difficult to read.</p>            <p id="5bd41dd0">In the latest version, we've added horizontal lines between issues and small vertical separators between the values for different fields.
