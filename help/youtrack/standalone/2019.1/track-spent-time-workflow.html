If you want to learn the fundamentals, read the <a href="Time-Management-Tutorial.html">Time Tracking Tutorial</a>. Here’s a brief overview.</p>  <p id="d7287541">This feature lets you quantify the effort that is invested into an issue.    This effort is recorded in work items.    Each work item logs the amount of time spent working on an issue.    These work items can be assigned different categories, like development, testing, or any other type of activity that you want to aggregate and track.</p>  <p id="1d0acbeb">Time tracking data is recorded in custom fields:</p>  <div class="table-wrapper"><table class="                 " width="100%" id="332e83f9"><thead><tr id="8a30c278" class="ijRowHead"><th id="bd3ae350" width="20%"><p>Field</p></th><th id="d0ee1837"><p>Description</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr id="c9c640db" class="ijRowOdd"><td id="8b201646"><p>Spent time</p></td><td id="da5997ca"><p>Displays the total amount of time that is recorded in all of the work items that have been added to the issue.</p></td></tr><tr id="3619c471" class="ijRowEven"><td id="e3397061"><p>Estimation</p></td><td id="90a71b35"><p>Stores the amount of time that you think would be required to complete the task.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>  <p id="936d0be2">By analyzing the difference between the values in these fields, you can measure the overall performance of your team.</p>  <p id="404d2cde">Time tracking can also be used without estimations when you just want to record your activity in billable hours.</p>  <p id="fb4e2618">By default, these fields store values as a period.    Period custom fields represent intervals of time in a human-readable form, so you record the estimation and view spent time in a number of weeks, days, and hours.    The number of working days per week and working hours per day are configured at the global level.    If you change these settings, the calculations are updated accordingly.    For more information, see <a href="Time-Tracking.html">Time Tracking</a>.</p>  <div class="chapter"><h2 id="default-workflows-that-track-time" data-toc="track-spent-time-workflow#default-workflows-that-track-time">Default Workflows that Track Time</h2>  <p id="f9e634d3">Work items are often used for billing, so it’s important that they are recorded accurately.    However, employees who are obliged to add these work items tend to either forget about them or try to cheat the system.    Both of these problems can be regulated with the help of workflows.</p>  <p id="66e318f5">YouTrack supplies default workflows that add work items to issues automatically under specific conditions.</p>  <div class="table-wrapper"><table class="                 " width="100%" id="d6073cd6"><thead><tr id="3e98e7b2" class="ijRowHead"><th id="1a5eef1f" width="20%"><p>Default Workflow</p></th><th id="1fece80c"><p>Description</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr id="ae4089d8" class="ijRowOdd"><td id="8737744c"><a href="Workflow-Work-Timer.html">In Progress Work Timer</a></td><td id="8371c914"><p>This workflow starts a time when an issue moves to the <span class="control">In Progress</span> state.

Adding work items with dates more than one week in the past is against the rules.</p>    <p id="3f20939e">The corresponding rule is written as follows:</p>    <div class="code-block" data-lang="javascript">var entities = require('@jetbrains/youtrack-scripting-api/entities');
var workflow = require('@jetbrains/youtrack-scripting-api/workflow');

var WEEK_IN_MS = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;

  },
  requirements: {}
});</div>    <p id="5084340a">When this rule is enabled, users cannot add work items with dates more than one week in the past.      If you want to make the restriction more stringent, you can limit the date to one or two days in the past.      It’s just a matter of setting the value for the constant. In our case, <code class="code">WEEK_IN_MS</code>.</p>    <p id="4e3cae45">Adding work items for dates in the future is also frowned upon, as it is impossible to accurately predict how much time will be spent working on the issue.</p>    <p id="e5dfbe90">Here’s a rule that clocks out the clairvoyants:</p>    <div class="code-block" data-lang="javascript">var entities = require('@jetbrains/youtrack-scripting-api/entities');

Users can still game the system by creating a work item with today’s date and editing the work item to use any date they like.</p>    <p id="cf58f1b9">Here’s a set of rules that apply the same restrictions used for adding work items in the past and future to block edits to work items that would violate the same policy:</p>    <div class="code-block" data-lang="javascript">var entities = require('@jetbrains/youtrack-scripting-api/entities');
