These events are recorded every time an operation is applied to a target entity that is managed by the built-in Hub service.                This includes changes that are applied to users, groups, projects, roles, auth modules, services, and resources, among others.                You can filter the list to search for specific types of activity or download the events as a JSON file for further investigation.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="dd7faaed"><p>Events that are considered to be security-related are printed to a dedicated <code class="code">security.log</code> file.

However, if your organization uses security information and event management software, a much better solution is to include your YouTrack log files as a data source.
