The user who installs YouTrack Standalone determines the initial status of the guest account when they set the <span class="control">Enable login as guest</span> option during installation.            This option is enabled by default.            Following installation, an administrator can ban or unban the guest account just like any other user.</p>        <p id="440ac0df">Even when enabled, the guest account isn't assigned any default roles.            If you want to expose a project to the public and let users browse issues anonymously, an administrator must grant access to the guest user on a per-project basis.

If you want to make issues in your projects available in read-only mode to anonymous users, you can grant the <span class="control">Issue Reader</span> role to the guest user in the <span class="control">Global</span> project.            This gives anonymous users the <span class="control">Read Issue</span> and <span class="control">Read Comment</span> permissions in all projects.            These permissions let guest users view any issue and its comments in any project.            This role also grants permission to read basic project information like the project name, description, and logo.</p>        <p id="bbc48039">Even in projects that are accessible to guest users, you still have the ability to restrict the visibility of issues and comments on a per-issue basis.

As a result, you don't need to revoke roles from the <span class="control">Global</span> project to make your projects private.</p>        <p id="ab211533">In older installations, the guest user is granted the <span class="control">Observer</span> role in the <span class="control">Global</span> project.        The default <span class="control">Observer</span> role has been modified to exclude access to issues in projects.            However, an administrator may have granted access to the guest user beyond the default role assignments.</p>            <p id="d5ce73ae">To restrict project access exclusively to members of the project team and other users or groups who are assigned direct roles in the project,            you'll need help from a system administrator.            Here are some important operations that are available to users who are assigned the default <span class="control">System Admin</span> role:</p>        <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="26f73847"><p>Restrict project access for anonymous users.                A system administrator can remove roles that are assigned to the guest account in the <span class="control">Global</span> project.                Project administrators can then allow guest access on a per-project basis.

It's common practice to assign roles to users and groups in the <span class="control">Global</span> project to ensure that a handful of users can perform similar duties in all projects.                You can check the set of permissions that are granted by these roles on the <span class="control">Access</span> tab in your project.                If you find that a particular role assignment in the <span class="control">Global</span> project exposes a greater level of access than is required, discuss the setup with a system administrator.                A system administrator can either update the permissions that are assigned to the role or revoke this level of access at the global level.</p></li></ul>    </div><div class="last-modified" data-skip-index="skip">Last modified: 8 July 2019 </div><div data-feedback-placeholder="true"></div><div class="navigation-links _bottom" data-skip-index="skip"><a class="navigation-links__prev" href="custom-project-templates.html">Custom Project Templates</a><a class="navigation-links__next" href="Time-Management-Tutorial.html">Time Tracking Tutorial</a></div></article><div id="disqus_thread" data-skip-index="skip"></div></div></section></main></div><script src="/help/app/v2/app.js"></script></body></html>
