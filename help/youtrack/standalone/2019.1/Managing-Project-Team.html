When you set the project owner, the selected user is assigned the <span class="control">Project Admin</span> role directly in the project.

There are operations that help synchronize the list of assignees with the project team, however, these two sets of users can be managed independently.            This means that your project team can include users who are not assigned issues and your issues can be assigned to users who are not members of the project team.</p>        <p id="eb608bf2">In YouTrack, assignees are taken from the set of values for the <span class="control">Assignee</span> field.

When you add users and groups to the project team, they are also added to the set of values for the <span class="control">Assignee</span> field.
