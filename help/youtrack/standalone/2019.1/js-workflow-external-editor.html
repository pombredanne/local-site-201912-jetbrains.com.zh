With a few modifications, you can build a platform that other developers can use to manage workflows in your YouTrack installation.            As this setup is not specific to any single environment, these developers can be working with any IDE that supports JavaScript in any operating system.</p>        <p id="d3ff43c9">The first thing you can do is modify your <code class="code">package.json</code> file.            Each of the developers who work with this setup will need to generate and store their own personal tokens, but the variables that are used for the host are the same for everybody.</p>        <p id="c2c4323d">To streamline the setup for other users, you can pull these variables into the <code class="code">package.json</code> file and update the references in your scripts.
