It lets you find issues that contain all forms of the words that you enter in a search query.                The downside of stemming is its inability to return issues that only contain the specified word form.</p>        <p id="c5f97693">The <span class="control">Single Term Search Optimization</span> feature assigns higher relevance scores to words that exactly match the specified word form in text searches that contain single terms.                As a result, it's easier to find issues that contain words that exactly match single terms in search queries.</p>        <div class="chapter"><h2 id="search-single-terms" data-toc="single-term-search-optimization#search-single-terms">Searching for Single Terms</h2>        <p id="58a497e3">To find issues that contain a word in a particular form, you have two options:</p>        <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="1236c72a"><p>Specify the word that you want to find in your search query and sort the results by relevance.

However, when the results are sorted by relevance, issues that contain the word <code class="code" data-lang="Java">documenting</code> appear higher in the list.

For example, <code class="code" data-lang="Java">"documenting" AND "source" AND "code"</code>.                        As long as the phrase doesn't contain any stop words, this workaround helps you find an exact match for a phrase.</p></li></ul>        <p id="eca33841">This feature doesn't support exact matches for all terms and phrases.                For example, if you want to find issues that contain code constructions like <code class="code" data-lang="Java">[i]++</code>, you won't find many matches in the search results.                That's because strings like this are not parsed as words and do not benefit from the optimization for single terms.                The ability to return exact matches for arbitrary strings will be delivered as a separate feature in an upcoming release.</p>        </div>        <div class="chapter"><h2 id="disable-single-search-term-optimization" data-toc="single-term-search-optimization#disable-single-search-term-optimization">Disabling Single Search Term Optimization</h2>                <p id="8b113266">The <span class="control">Single Search Term Optimization</span> feature is enabled by default.                Our development team has tested the feature extensively and has not observed any significant impact on performance.                By making this feature available to all users, we hope to gather additional information and identify special cases where the feature may have adverse effects.</p>                <p id="69189b91">The execution speed for search queries is affected by the size of your text index.                The text index increases in size based on the total number of terms that are stored in your issues for each indexed language.                If your issues cover a wide range of topics and are reported and indexed in multiple languages, your execution time for search queries may be slow.                The optimization for single search terms may increase execution time.</p>                <p id="0b72fb08">If you find that search execution becomes unbearably slow after you upgrade to YouTrack 2018.4, you can disable this feature.
