Any server that is exposed to the Internet is vulnerable to hackers who can destroy data, encrypt data and hold it for ransom, or steal your secrets.

Some even let you require the use of 2FA by every member of your organization.</p>        <p id="1ea28dda">With 2FA, users must use a secondary device to generate an authentication code, which they must then enter when they log in with their password.            This adds an extra layer of security.            Even if a password is compromised, the malicious user cannot access the application without the authentication code from the secondary device.</p>        <p id="cd6a1974">When users enable 2FA, they need to enter an authentication code every time they log into YouTrack with the account that is managed in the connected service.</p>    </div>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="enforce-password-policy" data-toc="Secure-Your-Installation#enforce-password-policy">Enforce a Password Policy</h2>        <p id="c964f9b7">If you're using third-party services for authentication and don't require 2FA, you can't guarantee that every user sets it up.
