If your team is distributed or just bigger, or if you want to integrate a Kanban board and an issue tracker anyway, consider using a YouTrack Agile board to manage your projects.</p>    <p id="3faddb44">The cards on the board represent issues to be processed by your team.        Advocates of the Kanban method use terms like <i id="277d7917">work item</i>,        but for this tutorial, the terms <i id="209ce142">work item</i>, <i id="6034e2fd">task</i>, <i id="f6d34c8e">issue</i> and <i id="7306f69f">card</i> are all synonymous.</p>    <p id="482f52dc">Continue reading to learn how to set up and use a Kanban board in YouTrack.

Your process can include many stages, and all of them are visualized on the board. Most development teams use three to seven columns.            This is a reasonable limit, as monitoring the board is essential in Kanban practice. The more columns you have, the harder they are to track.</p>        <p id="7b4411c5">Columns usually represent the development stage, department name, or anything else that you consider to be a stage in your work.            When you create a new card on the Kanban board, the card represents an issue in YouTrack.            One of the issue fields stores the stage. By default, the board uses a field that stores this value as a <code class="code" data-lang="Java">state</code> type.            When you move the card around the board, the field takes the value of the column that it has been moved to.</p>        <figure><img alt="kanban tutorial project config" title="kanban tutorial project config" src="/help/img/youtrack/2018.2/kanban_tutorial_project_config.png" id="ef1027f1" width="1281" height="696"></figure>        <p id="f9caa7b3">This example shows a state-type field that represents the development stages for issues in the project.            The field cannot be empty, which means that all new issues that are created in this project is displayed in the column that represents this value on the board when it is set.</p>        <p id="cb27912e">For best results, edit the set of values for an existing field that uses a state type.        If you add a new state-type field to your projects, be sure to remove any additional state-type fields.        Projects that use multiple state-type fields can be difficult to work with and require additional setup.        For more information, see <a href="Supported-Custom-Field-Types.html#stateTypeFields"><span>Possible Conflicts with Multiple State-type Fields</span></a>.</p>        <p id="655c8bb7">If you want to use a Kanban board with a new project, you can create the project and the board simultaneously with the Kanban project template.

Move the pointer over a date on the chart to see the number of cards in each stage on any date that is displayed on the report.</p>            <figure><img alt="kanban tutorial cumulative flow" title="kanban tutorial cumulative flow" src="/help/img/youtrack/2018.2/kanban_tutorial_cumulative_flow.png" id="02c1d6b8" width="1085" height="640"></figure>            <p id="9ed2a67b">On this graph, the vertical axis shows the number of tasks in each column. The horizontal axis represents time by date.</p>            <p id="0154d1bd">To see how quickly you're getting things done, look at the region between <span class="control">Open</span> and <span class="control">Done</span>.                This area represents all of the intermediate stages of development.                Basically, the steeper it decreases, the faster you're completing your workload and nearing the final release date.</p>            <p id="d92997c6">Also, the intermediate stages are supposed to shrink over time. If they are expanding, it could indicate a bottleneck.                It can also mean that you're adding more work to your system than your current capacity allows.</p>        </div>    </div><div class="last-modified" data-skip-index="skip">Last modified: 7 March 2019 </div><div data-feedback-placeholder="true"></div><div class="navigation-links _bottom" data-skip-index="skip"><a class="navigation-links__prev" href="Doing-Scrum-in-YouTrack.html">Scrum Boards</a><a class="navigation-links__next" href="Manage-Epics-on-Agile-Board.html">Agile Boards for Epics</a></div></article><div id="disqus_thread" data-skip-index="skip"></div></div></section></main></div><script src="/help/app/v2/app.js"></script></body></html>
