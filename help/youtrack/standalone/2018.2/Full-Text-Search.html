When you search for a value in an attribute that contains spaces, you set the value in braces.

This is an attribute-based search and returns only exact matches.        The query <code class="code" data-lang="Java">description: "Agile Board"</code> returns any issue that contains matches for the words "Agile Board" as a phrase in the issue description.

Matches in the issue summary are given a slightly higher weight than matches in other issue attributes.        Issues with multiple matches in the description, comments, or other issue attributes will have higher relevance than issues with a single match in the summary.</p>    </div>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="search-wildcards" data-toc="Full-Text-Search#search-wildcards">Wildcards in Text Search</h2>        <p id="26ae743e">You can use wildcards as a placeholder for one or more characters.        </p>            <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="06b59d37"><p><code class="code" data-lang="Java">*</code> — matches zero or more characters in a string.

When you search for text, YouTrack returns issues that contain all forms of the words that you enter in a search query.        For example, the search query <code class="code" data-lang="Java">description: {search attribute}</code> returns not only issues that contain either the words 'search' or 'attribute' in the description,        but also any issue that contains other forms of these words, including 'searches', 'searched', 'searching', 'attributes', 'attribution', and so on.        This feature helps you locate issues that might otherwise be excluded if the results included only exact word matches.</p>        <p id="a7379a17">Text indexing is automatically enabled for all default languages.            This means that stemming is enabled for all issue attributes that store strings of text in any of the languages that are provided out-of-the-box in YouTrack.            For English, text indexing cannot be disabled.</p>        <p id="011f064a">For more information, see <a href="Text-Index.html"><span>Text Index</span></a>.</p>        </div>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="search-tokenization" data-toc="Full-Text-Search#search-tokenization">Tokenization</h2>        <p id="6483c875">YouTrack breaks down each word in a string of text into tokens.

When you search for multiple words, the query is interpreted as a string of tokens.</p>        <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="8c26288a"><p>When the words are set in braces, each token is evaluated separately.

The text in an issue is broken down into words. Whitespaces and punctuation are used to determine where the words begin and end.            Periods and underscores are also recognized as delimiters.</p>        </div>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="fuzzy-search" data-toc="Full-Text-Search#fuzzy-search">Fuzzy Search</h2>    <p id="59f4ec87">To find words that match an approximate pattern, instead of an exact pattern, use a fuzzy search.        Fuzzy search finds words that are just a few characters off from the word that is specified in the search query.        This technique helps you account for misspellings, partial words, and slight differences in names.</p>        <p id="ac191310">For example, the search query <code class="code" data-lang="Java">comments: {michael~}</code> returns issues that include not only the name <code class="code" data-lang="Java">Michael</code> in the comments but also other spellings like <code class="code" data-lang="Java">Mikhail</code>.</p>        <p id="d442cf33">Fuzzy matching usually returns a large number of irrelevant matches            Use this option only when you know that the word you are searching for is likely to be misspelled.</p>    </div><div class="last-modified" data-skip-index="skip">Last modified: 7 March 2019 </div><div data-feedback-placeholder="true"></div><div class="navigation-links _bottom" data-skip-index="skip"><a class="navigation-links__prev" href="attribute-based-search.html">Attribute-based Search</a><a class="navigation-links__next" href="Search-Suggestions-User-Accounts.html">Search Suggestions for User Accounts</a></div></article><div id="disqus_thread" data-skip-index="skip"></div></div></section></main></div><script src="/help/app/v2/app.js"></script></body></html>
