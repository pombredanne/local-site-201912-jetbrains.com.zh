Even if a password is compromised, the malicious user cannot access the application without the authentication code from the secondary device.</p>        <p id="7774874c">When users enable 2FA, they need to enter an authentication code every time they log into YouTrack with the account that is managed in the connected service.</p>    </div>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="enforce-password-policy" data-toc="Secure-Your-Installation#enforce-password-policy">Enforce a Password Policy</h2>        <p id="4cd3d9db">If you're using third-party services for authentication and don't require 2FA, you can't guarantee that every user sets it up.
