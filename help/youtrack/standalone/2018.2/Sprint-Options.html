There are different sets of options for boards with sprints and boards without sprints.        This page explains how each option affects the behavior of your board.</p>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="agile-board-with-sprints" data-toc="Sprint-Options#agile-board-with-sprints">Options for Boards with Sprints</h2>        <p id="4e1d486f">With sprints enabled, an additional dimension is added to your board.            You have a series of sprints that can be assigned a duration in time.            Each issue is assigned not only to the board, but also to a specific sprint.            The board only displays issues that are assigned to the selected sprint.            Switching between sprints displays a different set of issues.</p>        <p id="6fdab11b">The board behavior options that are available for boards with sprints determine how issues are added to each sprint.</p>        <figure><img alt="sprintOptions" title="sprintOptions" src="/help/img/youtrack/2018.2/sprintOptions.png" id="d973043d" width="713" height="299"></figure>        <div class="chapter"><h3 id="board-with-sprints-manually-assign-issues">Manually Assign Issues</h3>            <p id="440f09df">This is the default option for new boards.                To add an issue to the board, you must explicitly assign it to a sprint.                You can either apply a command (<code class="code" data-lang="Java">Board &lt;board name&gt; &lt;sprint name&gt;</code>), drag an existing issue from the backlog to the sprint, or add an issue directly on the board.</p>            <p id="f80de99d">This option gives you the most control over which issues are assigned to each sprint.</p>            <p id="5216ff46">The two remaining options let you add issues to sprints automatically under certain conditions, however, you can still add issues manually to any sprint no matter which option you choose.</p>        </div>        <div class="chapter"><h3 id="add-new-to-sprint">Automatically Add New Issues to Sprint</h3>            <p id="c630afc0">With this option enabled, new issues are added to the selected sprint automatically.

Adding issues to the sprint automatically can add work that is outside the scope of the current sprint and defeats the purpose of sprint planning.</p>            <p id="f96c933a">Many teams use this option to assign issues to an unscheduled sprint that is used for planning.                All of the issues that are created in the projects are then visible on the board without having to check the backlog.                These teams review issues that have been added to the unscheduled sprint and assign them to scheduled sprints for implementation.</p>            <p id="4d0094ee">For boards that add issues automatically, issues that are linked as subtasks to cards on the board are added to the swimlane for uncategorized cards.            To remove subtasks from this swimlane, enable the <span class="control">Ignore subtasks of existing cards</span> option.

You can also use this option to link sprints to custom fields that store any enumerated type, including fields that store a <code class="code" data-lang="Java">build</code>, <code class="code" data-lang="Java">state</code>, <code class="code" data-lang="Java">version</code>, <code class="code" data-lang="Java">ownedField</code>, or <code class="code" data-lang="Java">enum</code>.</p>            <p id="52d35d96">For boards that add issues automatically, issues that are linked as subtasks to cards on the board are added to the swimlane for uncategorized cards.

The value that is displayed in the auto-completion popup is not stored in the query — only the text-based variable.</p>            <figure><a class="lightbox" href="/help/img/youtrack/2018.2/sprintOptionsRelativeValueQuery.zoomed.png"><img alt="sprintOptionsRelativeValueQuery" title="sprintOptionsRelativeValueQuery" src="/help/img/youtrack/2018.2/sprintOptionsRelativeValueQuery.png" id="8a929542" width="600" height="159"></a></figure>            <p id="0401f6de">This means that a query like <code class="code" data-lang="Java">created: {this month}</code> shows issues that were created during the current month.                As soon as the calendar changes to the next month (in this case, from November to December), any issue that was created the month prior disappears when the board is refreshed.</p>            <p id="11225f62">If you use relative parameters in a query, you may experience strange behavior with:</p>            <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="9a4b3eeb"><p>Live update — cards that match the filter criteria when the board is opened can disappear when the issue no longer matches the criteria after an update is applied.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="fab0285b"><p>Workflow support — workflows that react to sprint changes can apply unexpected changes.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="8570f1b4"><p>Adding issue to a sprint from the backlog — issues in the backlog that do not match the parameters in the query cannot be added to the sprint.</p></li></ul>            <p id="a7bb46a9">You can use a board with a relative query as an alternative view to the issues list, but we don't recommend that you use this type of board to update issues.</p>        </div>        <div class="chapter"><h3 id="agile-board-personal-query">Personal Queries</h3>            <p id="c6dc2d3d">The value for search queries that include the keyword <code class="code" data-lang="Java">me</code> is also recalculated every time the board is opened or refreshed.                You can use this parameter to a create one board that gives each user a view of their own issues.                For example, a search query like <code class="code" data-lang="Java">#unresolved for: me</code> shows only unresolved issues for the currently logged-in user.

This is because the subtasks meet the criteria for being displayed on the board, but don't contain the attribute that defines an existing swimlane.</p>            Given that subtasks are displayed on cards in XL view, showing subtasks on the board can create unnecessary visual clutter.        <p id="36e85a72">To remove subtasks from the swimlane for uncategorized cards, enable the <span class="control">Ignore subtasks of existing cards</span> option.        This option is only active when the selected board behavior option adds cards to the board automatically.
