In Scrum development, these estimates are commonly recorded in relative units that let teams measure the relative complexity of a task.</p>    <p id="8594bc46">Some teams choose a different approach and estimate their efforts in intervals of real time.        By logging the amount of time spent working on each issue, the team can measure how the actual work compares to their original estimation.</p>    <p id="153ff1b5">When you enable the Time Tracking feature, you can update and track these values on an agile board.        This feature has its advantages no matter which type of agile practice you follow.</p>    <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="593046c8"><p>On a Scrum board, the estimations and spent time can be used to calculate the burndown for each sprint.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="3f45447e"><p>On a Kanban board, the total estimation and spent time show you how much work is currently allocated to each stage of development.</p></li></ul>    <p id="888ededa">Time tracking is often used by agencies to monitor the amount of work performed for different clients.    You can create separate agile boards and track spent time independently for each project or use dedicated swimlanes for different clients and track all of your work on a single board.</p>    <p id="65a51b50">This tutorial shows you how to set up and use the Time Tracking feature on an agile board.</p>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="Enable-time-tracking" data-toc="Time-Tracking-on-Agile-Board#Enable-time-tracking">Configure Your Projects</h2>        <p id="f04a411c">Before you can use the Time Tracking feature on an agile board, you must enable and configure the feature in each of the projects that are managed on the board.
