Some even let you require the use of 2FA by every member of your organization.</p>        <p id="ced40d15">With 2FA, users must use a secondary device to generate an authentication code, which they must then enter when they log in with their password.

Even if a password is compromised, the malicious user cannot access the application without the authentication code from the secondary device.</p>        <p id="d924e584">When users enable 2FA, they need to enter an authentication code every time they log into YouTrack with the account that is managed in the connected service.</p>    </div>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="enforce-password-policy" data-toc="Secure-Your-Installation#enforce-password-policy">Enforce a Password Policy</h2>        <p id="b7d4949e">If you're using third-party services for authentication and don't require 2FA, you can't guarantee that every user sets it up.
