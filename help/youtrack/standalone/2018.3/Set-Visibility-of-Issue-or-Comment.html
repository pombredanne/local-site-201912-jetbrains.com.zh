This means that you can specify which groups and users can see an issue.        You can also apply separate visibility restrictions to a comment or an attachment.</p>        <p id="1a984922">By default, all issues and comments are visible to the <span class="control">All Users</span> group.

You can restrict read access for an issue within the scope that is set at the project level.            Issue-level visibility settings cannot override the access permissions that are defined for the project, but can limit the visibility to a smaller subset of users.</p>           <p id="a3be156c">For example, if groups A and B are granted roles that let them read issues in a project,            you can restrict the visibility of an issue to group A or group B, or to users who are members of either group.            While it is possible set the visibility of an issue to another group, for example, group C,            the members of this group do not have access permissions in the project and cannot view the issue.</p>        <p id="ef3e2ed2">Issues with visibility restrictions display a padlock icon.
