When migrating to this model, YouTrack collected the list of users and groups who were assigned the <span class="control">Project Admin</span> or <span class="control">Developer</span> role in each project.        These are the two roles that were marked as team roles by default.        These users and groups were then added to the project team.</p>    <p id="37d226e8">During the migration, YouTrack automatically merged redundant groups into their corresponding project teams.        The purpose of this cleanup was to remove &lt;project name&gt;-team groups.        These groups were created automatically when a project was added to YouTrack.        Their purpose was to assign the <span class="control">Developer</span> role to users who were added to the project team based on their membership in these groups.        As these groups duplicate role assignments that are now granted directly to members of the project team, YouTrack merges these groups into project teams during upgrade.</p>    <p id="6008c98d">Most of the groups that could be safely merged into a project team without resulting in a permission loss have already been merged.        However, you may still have groups that can be merged into a project team without affecting access rights in other projects.        If you encounter a group that duplicates the memberships and role assignments that are available to users as members of a project team, you can merge it into a project team from the <span class="control">Groups</span> tab.        Use the list on the <span class="control">Groups and Teams</span> tab to double-check the roles that are assigned to the group and the project team before you perform this operation.</p>    <p id="7a10bf18">For newer installations, you may consider using this action to remove groups whose role assignments are redundant with the roles that are available to a project team.        This can occur when you grant an additional role to a project team that is duplicated by a group role assignment.</p>    <p id="732e7d5a">When you perform this operation:</p>    <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="150c19f6"><p>Members of the selected group become members of the project team.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="11aa6cc7"><p>If there are any groups that are nested under the selected group, these subgroups are added as groups to the project team.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="446b6906"><p>Members of the group and its subgroups are granted access as defined by the roles that are assigned to the team in the project.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="8e99fe22"><p>The selected group is deleted from YouTrack.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="7c0a9244"><p>Roles and access permissions that are granted to users as members of the deleted group are revoked.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="38463b72"><p>References to the deleted group in all projects and connected services are set to the project team.</p></li></ul>    <aside class="tip sideblock" data-title="Permissions" rel="merge-to-team-procedure" id="3621a917"><br><br>        <p id="c4ec9d19"><img alt="Icon globe" title="Icon globe" src="/help/img/youtrack/2018.3/iconGlobe.png" id="9ef28a5e" width="14" height="15" class="inline-icon-14"> Read Role</p>        <p id="09dc99fe"><img alt="Icon globe" title="Icon globe" src="/help/img/youtrack/2018.3/iconGlobe.png" id="064be779" width="14" height="15" class="inline-icon-14"> Update Role</p>        <p id="b489812b"><img alt="Icon globe" title="Icon globe" src="/help/img/youtrack/2018.3/iconGlobe.png" id="d6cdf262" width="14" height="15" class="inline-icon-14"> Read Service</p>        <p id="c67bce60">— Read Project Full</p>        <p id="ed87e09f">— Update Project</p>        <p id="cffc69dc">— Read Group</p>        <p id="d8a976a5">— Delete Group</p>    </aside>    <section class="procedure-steps"><h2 id="merge-to-team-procedure">To merge a group into a project team:</h2><ol class="list _decimal"><li class="list__item" id="b27a34d6"><p>From the <span class="control">Access Management</span> section of the <span class="control">Administration</span> menu, select <span class="control">Groups</span>.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="6cf94016"><p>Select a group in the <span class="control">Groups</span> list.
