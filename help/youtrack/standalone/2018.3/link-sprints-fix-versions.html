These releases can be delivered intermediately through continuous deployment or collected and delivered as a new major version.</p>        <p id="bef634d5">Our first version of the agile board in YouTrack followed this model to the letter.        When it was first released in YouTrack version 4, all sprints were linked to fix versions by default.          Fixing issues during a specific sprint automatically sets the value for the linked field for fix version.        When issues are rescheduled for subsequent sprints or are abandoned completely, the value in the linked field is updated as well.</p>  <p id="91acfe18">Since its initial release, we've relaxed the restrictions to support other agile frameworks.    We preserved the original functionality by introducing a version-based board template that links sprints to a custom field.</p>  <p id="1b6cc4c9">Several teams here at JetBrains became early adopters of the YouTrack agile board.          They used this feature as the basis for their Scrum framework.  Other teams have adapted the version-based board to show issues that are assigned to each release version of the product, even when they don't follow a strict agile methodology.</p>          <p id="5c44d6c5">One of the early adopters was the dotMemory team.            Here's what their board looks like in our YouTrack installation:</p>  <figure><a class="lightbox" href="/help/img/youtrack/2018.3/version-based-board.zoomed.png"><img alt="Version based board" title="Version based board" src="/help/img/youtrack/2018.3/version-based-board.png" id="5b9e9671" width="600" height="413"></a></figure>          <p id="d50ef6c2">Their board supports the following process:</p>  <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="a0226035"><p>Each sprint is liked to a value in the <span class="control">Fix versions</span> field.    Their release cycles are synchronized with major releases for ReSharper.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="64ef28cd"><p>For each version, they pick two or three big features to work on.      They break down the development of these features into smaller tasks and track the progress in each swimlane.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="f981c097"><p>Small features and bugs are managed in the swimlane for uncategorized cards.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="dcef69a6"><p>They use the <span class="control">To do</span> column as a backlog of issues that should be fixed in the current development version.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="3a2e3d23"><p>Each member of the team will have one or two issues in development at a time.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="10c096fd">When done, features that are exposed in the user interface will move to the <span class="control">Demo</span> column.

This column is for issues that are tested in the feature branch before they are merged into the master branch.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="bb7c4df7"><p>One month prior to release, the team reviews any unresolved issues in the sprint.      Issues that won’t be fixed in this version are either postponed to the next sprint or returned to the backlog.      These updates are applied simply by changing the value of the <span class="control">Fix version</span> field in each issue.</p></li></ul>        <p id="cae82be0">This type of board can be useful for teams that follow a Scrum agile framework or track issues that are assigned to release versions of the product.</p>        <section class="procedure-steps"><h2 id="52ccbba9">To build a board like this:</h2><ol class="list _decimal"><li class="list__item" id="9dc67c9f">Create your board.                        <figure><a class="lightbox" href="/help/img/youtrack/2018.3/version-based-create-board.zoomed.png"><img alt="Version based create board" title="Version based create board" src="/help/img/youtrack/2018.3/version-based-create-board.png" id="ee792fe3" width="600" height="235"></a></figure>                        <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="e3bf8a7d"><p>Use the <span class="control">Version-based board</span> template.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="999dee44"><p>Select the projects that you want to manage on the board.<br><br>                                  When you link sprints to fix versions, you’re normally dealing with a single project.
