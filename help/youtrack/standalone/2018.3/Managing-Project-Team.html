There are operations that help synchronize the list of assignees with the project team, however, these two sets of users can be managed independently.            This means that your project team can include users who are not assigned issues and your issues can be assigned to users who are not members of the project team.</p>        <p id="8d3cedba">In YouTrack, assignees are taken from the set of values for the <span class="control">Assignee</span> field.

When you add users and groups to the project team, they are also added to the set of values for the <span class="control">Assignee</span> field.            It is also possible to add users to the list of assignees without adding them as a member to the project team.
