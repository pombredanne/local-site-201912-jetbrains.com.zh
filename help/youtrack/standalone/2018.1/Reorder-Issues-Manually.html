For example, you want to prioritize the first 200 issues in your backlog but can only display 100 issues per page.        This situation worsens when you use tree view, as each nested subtask in the list counts toward the per-page limit.        Currently, there aren't any controls that let you take issue from one page and assign them to the custom order on another page.</p>        <p id="f1571085">If you find yourself facing this limitation, consider one of the following workarounds.</p>        <div class="chapter"><h3 id="prioritize-fewer-issues">Prioritize Fewer Issues</h3>            <p id="9a9403f3">The simplest solution is to limit the number of issues that you reorder manually to fewer than 100 issues.                If you're working on a project with a ginormous backlog, there's little chance that you can prioritize everything on your list anyway.            Consider a two-stage approach for prioritization:</p>            <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="fdfb6a74"><p>Review all of the issues in your current backlog and identify the issues that belong to your current or nearest development roadmap.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="0efe6d1f"><p>Use a tag to mark all of these issues. For example, <span class="control">Current Roadmap</span>.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="d7c19f92"><p>Add this tag to the saved search that you use to apply a custom order.                If you still have more than 100 issues, either use a second batch of tags or add criteria to your search to exclude issues with normal or lower priority. </p></li></ul>            <p id="a1bc678e">Once you have fewer than 100 issues to manage, select the saved search as the search context and set your custom order.            When you resolve an issue, remove the <span class="control">Current Roadmap</span> tag.                Every time you revisit your roadmap, review your backlog and tags issues accordingly.</p>        </div>        <div class="chapter"><h3 id="use-different-attribute-for-sorting">Use a Different Sort Attribute</h3>            <p id="fee9e3c3">If your list is extremely long and you absolutely have to prioritize everything, manual sorting isn't the best option for you anyway.            Take the manual element out of the equation and find a project prioritization method that works for your team.</p>            <p id="c337b395">The goal here is to generate a value for each issue that represents its priority relative to other issues in your project.                You then store these values in a dedicated field.            Build a scorecard that lets you evaluate each issue based on its overall impact on your customer base or any other range of critical factors.</p>            <p id="7f221a23">When you've finished scoring all of the issues that you want to prioritize, discard the custom order and sort the list by values in your custom field.            If you assign a prioritization score to new issues in your project, they are added to the list in their proper place automatically.</p>        </div>    </div>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="max-ordered-issues" data-toc="Reorder-Issues-Manually#max-ordered-issues">Max Ordered Issues</h2>        <p id="b34895cd">The maximum number of issues that you can apply a custom order to is set at the global level for your YouTrack installation.            If you exceed the global limit, an error is shown.        The default number of issues you can sort manually for a single project, saved search, or tag is 500.</p>        <p id="6c2e67d4">If you need to set a custom order for a larger number, contact an administrator.
