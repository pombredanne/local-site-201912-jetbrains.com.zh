You don't need to dig into complex settings; you can just define your own rules, and the issue tracker follows them exactly.        The rules automate assignments, manage time, implement policies, generate reports, send notifications, and escalate issues.        They also maintain inter-project dependencies, and never forget to do their work.</p>    <p id="9347f384">This is what YouTrack workflows can do for you.        Workflows are not processes that are defined once and for all — they are sets of rules that you can modify at any time.</p>    <p id="10e396f1">There is a wide variety of workflows that are ready to be attached to your projects.        The use cases described here are supported by default workflows that are bundled with YouTrack and custom workflows that you can download from the workflow repository.       Plus, you can always extend the available functionality by creating your own workflows.</p>    <p id="67e2c7df">Let's explore some ideas that put workflows to work.</p>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="automate-assignments" data-toc="Workflow-Use-Cases#automate-assignments">Automate Assignments</h2>        <p id="0bd0bf8a">Would you like the issue tracker to know who is responsible for what in your team, and assign appropriate issues to them automatically?
