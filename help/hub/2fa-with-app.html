This method of authentication is based on the Time-based One-Time Password algorithm (TOTP).        This algorithm is supported by a range of popular authentication apps, including        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2" data-external="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Authenticator</a>,        <a href="https://1password.com/" data-external="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1Password</a>,        <a href="https://authy.com/" data-external="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Authy</a>, and        <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/business-password-manager" data-external="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LastPass</a>.</p>    </div>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="hardware-limitations" data-toc="2fa-with-app#hardware-limitations">Limitations</h2>        <p id="9286dc5b">App-based authentication in Hub is subject to the following limitations:</p>        <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="7f2a6223"><p id="4a0d15c8"><b id="a6423e0b">You are limited to one type of two-factor authentication.</b>                This means that you can't use token-based authentication together with app-based authentication.                Once you pair your Hub account with a hardware token, the option to set up app-based authentication is not available.                To switch from token-based authentication to app-based 2FA, you must first unregister the hardware device that you currently use as a second factor.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="0b2bdcbf"><p id="c8a4c14d"><b id="4b602720">Hub only requests the second factor for password-based logins.</b>                If you use an authentication method that is supported by a third-party auth module, like Google or GitHub, the second factor is not required.                Many of these services support 2FA as well, so you can still protect your Hub account when you log in with these auth modules.                You just need to set up 2FA for your account in the service that is supported by the auth module.</p>            <p id="5ccd5e89">If you are a member of a group for which 2FA is required, you must set up a second authentication factor for any auth modules that support login with a username and password.                You can either delete your password-based credentials and continue to log in with third-party authentication or set up 2FA for your account as described here.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="8845ed50"><p id="1cec2993"><b id="d550d65c">Basic authentication for the Hub REST API with login and password doesn't work with 2FA enabled.</b>                You can still use a permanent token to authenticate without having to disable 2FA.
