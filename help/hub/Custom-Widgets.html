Extend the functionality of your dashboards to grab content from external sources or present data from connected services in a unique format.        Support for this feature has also been added to the new <span class="control">Project Overview</span> page.</p>    <p id="a44b2e91">If you're not quite confident in your own ability to create a custom widget, you can access widgets built by other users that have been uploaded to the <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com" data-external="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JetBrains Plugins Repository</a>.        You might find exactly the widget you're looking for without having to build it yourself.</p>    <p id="1c4b7ee7">This section of the documentation describes how to manage available widgets on the <span class="control">Custom Widgets</span> page of your Hub installation.    If you want to learn more about building widgets, see <a href="building-custom-widgets.html">Widget Development Guide</a>.</p>    <p id="90470b5e">Custom widgets help you create a consolidated overview of the information that is important to your team.    For example:</p>    <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="f833cb3b"><p>Your Quality Assurance team uses dedicated software for testing.        You can build a custom widget that displays a list of failing tests.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="3dfa7498"><p>Your Customer Support Engineers use dedicated software for managing support requests.        You can build a custom widget that displays the number of unanswered requests.</p></li></ul>    <p id="ae88245d">For more examples, see <a href="sample-custom-widgets.html">Sample Custom Widgets</a>.</p>    <p id="67a834ad">Manage the status of each widget in a central location on the <span class="control">Custom Widgets</span> page.

These widgets can pull information from external sources or connected services.        They can potentially display data from Hub, TeamCity, Upsource, and YouTrack.</p>        <p id="23e7cb5e">TeamCity itself does not have a platform for displaying widgets.            However, it is possible to build custom widgets that display information from a TeamCity server.            Like the <a href="TeamCity-Widgets.html">TeamCity Widgets</a> that are built into Hub, these widgets can be installed on Hub dashboards and project overview pages only when TeamCity is connected as a service in Hub.</p>        <p id="755ec386">A widget that displays data from TeamCity is only compatible with an external Hub installation.</p>    </div>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="upsource-custom-widgets" data-toc="Custom-Widgets#upsource-custom-widgets">Widgets in Upsource</h2>        <p id="055d739b">An Upsource installation is always connected to a Hub service.        When Upsource is installed as a standalone application, the Hub service is bundled with the installation package.        Upsource can also be connected to an external Hub.</p>        <p id="368baf12">If you're not using an external Hub, you can install custom widgets on dashboards that are accessible from the bundled Hub service.        These dashboards can display both Hub widgets and Upsource widgets.</p>            <p id="572e26ec">The latest version of Upsource (2017.3) is bundled with Hub version 2017.4.                In this version of Hub, custom widgets are only available on an experimental basis.</p>            <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="adf237ec"><p>The feature must be enabled separately in the built-in Hub service.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="7dfd47bf"><p>The integration with the JetBrains Plugins Repository is not supported.</p></li></ul>            <p id="6577b513">If you want to use custom widgets in your Upsource installation, consider migrating to an external Hub installation that fully supports this feature.
