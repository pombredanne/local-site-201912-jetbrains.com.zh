That's because many of its permission checks are delegated to the external Hub service but Hub no longer recognizes or trusts the external service.</p>    <p id="eaa176e6">The process for restoring a deleted service depends on how tightly it integrates with Hub.</p>    <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="b0bdd881"><p>Services that don't supply permissions or resources to Hub can be restored just by opening the <span class="control">Services</span> page and adding them again.
