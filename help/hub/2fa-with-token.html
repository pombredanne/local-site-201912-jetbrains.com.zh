Many hardware security keys are designed to be plugged into a USB 3.x port, which most mobile devices don't have.            If you secure your account with this type of device in the browser on your desktop machine, you will probably need to use an adapter to authenticate with this device on your mobile devices.            Here are a few alternatives that you might use to authenticate on both desktop and mobile:</p>        <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="9d126d07"><p>Use a security key that connects to a USB-C port.

These keys can usually be plugged into the USB port on your desktop computer and connect to a mobile device over NFC.                To pair the security key with your account on a mobile device, the mobile device must support NFC as well.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="24391f54"><p>Use a security key that supports a Bluetooth connection.
