We take great care to eliminate exposures to different types of attacks.        We work with third-parties who scan Hub for vulnerabilities and perform penetration tests.        When a security issue is discovered, we strive to address the problem in the next major version or bug-fix release.</p>    <p id="7c277a56">The recommendations on this page are intended to help you keep your Hub data secure.        These best practices can help you avoid pitfalls that leave your data vulnerable to theft, damage, or loss.</p>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="document-security-plan" data-toc="secure-your-hub-installation#document-security-plan">Document Your Setup</h2>        <p id="b46bc899">Documentation is an important part of your security plan.            If your Hub administration changes hands, the new administrator shouldn't have to learn how the application is configured through trial and error.            As you follow this guide to secure your Hub environment, make a note of each change and explain why you set it up the way you did.            When done, collect your notes and add them to your information security policy documentation.</p>    </div>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="security-updates" data-toc="secure-your-hub-installation#security-updates">Stay Up To Date</h2>            <p id="145a0008">To ensure that your installation includes the most recent security enhancements, make sure you always use the latest version of Hub.

Any server that is exposed to the Internet is vulnerable to hackers who can destroy data, encrypt data and hold it for ransom, or steal your secrets.

To ensure that your data is secure, we recommend that you apply filesystem-level or full disc encryption to the server that runs Hub.

Many of the third-party authentication modules that are supported in Hub also support 2FA.            Hub lets you require 2FA for every member of your organization.        Users can choose to protect their accounts with app-based or token-based 2FA.</p>        <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="57ae1755"><p>With app-based 2FA, users must use an external app to generate an authentication code, which they must then enter when they log in with their password.                This adds an extra layer of security.                Even if a password is compromised, the malicious user cannot access the application without the authentication code from the external app.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="dc33b42f"><p>With token-based 2FA, users pair their Hub account with a hardware device.

YouTrack supports features like the Mailbox Integration that creates user accounts from incoming email messages and the Zendesk Integration that can create accounts when importing tickets.            The option to require email verification prevents users from registering accounts that can be used to gain unauthorized access to Hub and other applications in your business environment.</p>        <p id="2f9db94e">The option to require email verification is located on the <span class="control">Auth Modules &gt; Common Settings</span> page in Hub.

Permissions are assigned to a collection of roles, which are then granted to users and groups for a specific project.            Users only have permission to perform the operations that are allowed for the role that they are assigned in each project.</p>        <p id="d5d00ddd">If you are overly-generous with granting permissions, you expose your system to high risk from insider threats.            It also gives external hackers access to sensitive data as soon as any of your accounts is compromised.</p>        <p id="14fa0edc">We recommend that you follow the principle of least privilege and only grant access to the information and resources that are absolutely necessary to perform the operations that are required for each user.

However, if your organization uses security information and event management software, a much better solution is to include your Hub log files as a data source.                These solutions let you scan and analyze aggregated log files and generate alerts when a suspicious pattern of activity is detected.</p>            <p id="7ca88b21">Follow these guidelines to secure your log files:</p>            <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="59c597eb"><p>Ensure that only individuals who have a job-related need have access to the data directory where you store your Hub log files.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="70c82f6e"><p>Create backup copies of your Hub log files on a centralized log server.</p></li></ul>        </div>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="limit-access-sensitive-information" data-toc="secure-your-hub-installation#limit-access-sensitive-information">Limit Access to Sensitive Information</h2>        <p id="63a71d79">If you store sensitive information in your issues, take extra efforts to make sure this data is secure.</p>        <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="8749a87e"><p>Use dedicated projects to store issues that contain information that can be used to identify a person.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="a7bca7d3"><p>Make sure the users who have access to issues in this project understand the sensitivity of this information.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="5b5698dd"><p>Restrict project access to the users who need to view and use this information.</p></li></ul>    </div>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="restrict-anonymous-access" data-toc="secure-your-hub-installation#restrict-anonymous-access">Restrict Anonymous Access</h2>            <p id="f36a98da">By default, all Hub installations include a dedicated user account for guests.                While this account isn't granted any roles in Hub, it can be allowed limited access in connected services like YouTrack and Upsource.                If your installation is accessible from outside your network, anyone who knows your server address can use the guest account to browse issues and code in your projects without having to log in.</p>            <p id="ed089cc6">If you wish to limit or block anonymous access, you have the following options:</p>            <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="10de03cc"><p>You can revoke the role that is assigned to the guest account in the <span class="control">Global</span> project.
