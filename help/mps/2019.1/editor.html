An editor displays the node and lets the user modify, replace, delete it and so on. Nodes of different concepts have different editors. A language designer should create an editor for every concept in his/her language.</p>   <p id="333b060c">In MPS, an editor consists of cells, which themselves contain other cells, some text, or a UI component. Each editor has its concept for which it is specified. A concept may have no more than one editor declaration (or can have none). If a concept does not have an editor declaration, its instances will be edited with an editor for the concept's nearest ancestor that has an editor declaration.</p>   <p id="32ab8ab4">To describe an editor for a certain concept (i.e. which cells have to appear in an editor for nodes of this concept), a language designer will use a dedicated language simply called <i id="65febc37">editor language</i>. You see, MPS applies the <i id="1f9b50be">Language Oriented Programming</i> principles to itself.</p>   <p id="73fcd95b">The description of an editor consists of descriptions for cells it holds. We call such descriptions "cell models." For instance, if you want your editor to consist of a unique cell with unmodifiable text, you create in your editor description a constant cell model and specify that text. If you want your editor to consist of several cells, you create a collection cell model and then, inside it, you specify cell models for its elements.

The resulting cell will contain an editor for the link's target (almost always for the child, not the referent).

Therefore child cells cannot be used for such a purpose. One should use referent cells. <br> Referent cell allows you to show a different inlined editor for a reference target, instead of using target's own editor.

For instance, an editor for a method call will contain a child list cell for rendering its actual arguments. Child list can be indent (text like), horizontal or vertical. <br>The cell generated from this cell model supports insertion and deletion of the children of the role given, thus serving both as a view and as a controller. The default keys for insertion are Insert and Enter (to insert a child before or after the selected one, respectively), and the default key for deletion is Delete. You also can specify a separator for your list. <br>A separator is a character which will be shown in constant cells between cells for the children. When you are inside the cell list and you press a key with this character, a new child will be inserted after the selected child. For instance, a separator for a list representing actual parameters in a method call is a comma. <br>In Inspector, you can specify whether the resulting cell list will use folding or not, and whether it will use braces or not.

Every state should be taken from and written into a model (i.e. node, its properties and references) - not a view (your component). <br> A good use case for such a cell model is when you keep a path to some file in a property, and your component is a button which activates a modal file chooser.

The latter two are somewhat optional. <br> A "get" method takes a node and should return a String, which will be shown as the cell's text. A "set" method takes a String - the cell's text - and should modify a node according to this String, if necessary. A "validate" method takes the cell's text and returns whether it is valid or not. If a text in a cell becomes invalid after a user change, then it is marked red and is not passed to the "set" method. <br> If a "validate" method is not specified, a cell will always be valid.

When developing an extension to <i id="d0a4cf8b">BaseLanguage</i>, you should apply keyword style to new keywords, field style to new types of fields, and so forth.</p>   <p id="2a61c51f">A <b id="6fd2a57f">stylesheet</b> is quite similar to CSS stylesheets; it consists of a list of style classes, in which the values for some style properties are specified.&nbsp;MPS additionally provides a mechanism for extending styles as well as for property value overriding.</p>      <h2 id="styleproperties">Style properties</h2>      <h3 id="booleanstyleproperties">Boolean style properties</h3>   <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="3f4f7c93"><p>         <i id="cf85baf4">selectable</i> - whether the cell can be selected.

There's a common editor for all binary operations which consists of a cell for left operand, a cell for operation sign which is a cell for concept property "alias" and a cell for right operand.</p>[&gt; % leftExpression % ^{{ alias }} % rightExpression % &lt;]<p id="8bab8f01">It is natural to create a cell menu for a cell with operation sign, which will allow to replace an operation sign with another one, (by replacing a whole node of course). For such a purpose one will write in the cell for operation sign a replace node menu part:</p>replace node (custom node concept)   replace with: BinaryOperation<p id="a010620e">The former left child and right child are added to newly created BinaryOperation according to <a href="editor-actions.html#node_factories">Node Factories</a> for BinaryOperation concept.</p>      <h3 id="replacechildmenu(customchild'sconcept)">Replace child menu (custom child's concept)</h3>   <p id="776ab714">Such a cell menu part is applicable to a cell for a certain child and specifies a specific concept which and subconcepts of which will be shown in completion menu (and instantiated when chosen and the instance will be set as a child).

Hence, to write such a menu one should specify matching text, description text and write a function returning a node (this node should be an instance of a target concept specified in a respective child link).</p>      <h3 id="genericmenuitem">Generic menu item</h3>   <p id="8e8dc5a8">This kind of cell menu part allows one to make MPS perform an arbitrary action when a respective menu item will be selected in a completion menu. One should specify matching text for a menu item and write a function which does what one wants. For instance, one may not want to show a child list cell for class fields if no class fields exist. Hence one can't use its default actions to create a new field. Instead, one can create somewhere in a class' editor a generic menu item with matching text "create field" which creates a new field for a class.</p>generic item   matching text: add field   handler: (node, model, scope, operationContext)-&gt;void {                node. field. add new ( &lt;default&gt; );             }   <h3 id="actiongroups">Action groups</h3>   <p id="a82bfc9b">An action group is a cell menu part which returns a group of custom actions. At runtime, during the menu construction, several objects of a certain type, which are called parameter objects, are collected or created. For that parameter object type of an action group functions, which return their matching text and description text, are specified. A function which is triggered when a menu item with a parameter object is chosen is specified also.</p>   <p id="807e167b">Thus, an action group description consists of:</p>   <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="f9da2ec6"><p>a parameter object type;</p></li><li class="list__item" id="00e2d1b4"><p>a function which returns a list of parameter objects of a specified type (takes an edited node, scope and operation context);</p></li><li class="list__item" id="113c654b"><p>a function which takes a parameter object of a specified type and returns matching text (a text which will be shown in a completion menu);</p></li><li class="list__item" id="1569c628"><p>a function which takes a parameter object of a specified type and returns description text for a parameter object;</p></li><li class="list__item" id="cc7885e7"><p>a function which performs an action when parameter object is chosen in a completion menu.</p></li></ul>   <p id="6c153f39">A function which performs an action may be of different kinds, so there are three different kinds of cell action group menu parts:</p>   <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="c22892d4"><p>Generic action group.

For such a purpose cell menu components are meant. A cell menu component consists of a cell menu descriptor (a container for cell menu parts) and a specification of an applicable feature. A specification of applicable feature contains a reference to a feature (i.e. child link declaration, reference link declaration or property declaration), to which a menu is applicable. For instance if your menu component will be used to replace some child its child link declaration should be specified here; etc.</p>   <p id="ffa98842">When a cell menu component is created, it can be used in cell menus via cell menu component menu part, which is a cell menu part which contains a reference to a certain menu component.<a href="smodel-language.html">SModel language</a>   </p>   <h2 id="customizingreferencepresentation">Customizing reference presentation</h2>   <p id="0c6a9f37">Specification of the matching text and in-editor textual presentation for references can be done directly in the editor aspect.</p>   <p id="1deb0ced">The&nbsp;<i id="fa20061a">ref. presentation</i> cell can have the displayed text customized:</p>         <figure><a class="lightbox" href="/help/img/idea/2019.1/RefCust1.png"><img alt="RefCust1" title="RefCust1" src="/help/img/idea/2019.1/RefCust1.png" id="b84ffdaa" width="500" height="722"></a></figure>      <p id="ceaeab2d">The&nbsp;<i id="772e699d">cell menu</i> can customise the text displayed in the completion menu:</p>         <figure><a class="lightbox" href="/help/img/idea/2019.1/RefCust2.png"><img alt="RefCust2" title="RefCust2" src="/help/img/idea/2019.1/RefCust2.png" id="0b39e5e5" width="500" height="730"></a></figure>      <p id="a1458141">This functionality was previously achieved through&nbsp;<i id="e76544c4">Constraints</i>.</p>   <h2 id="migrationofpresentationqueryinreferenceconstraints">Migration of presentation query in reference constraints</h2>   <p id="8f190853">The design of the reference presentation part in the constraints&nbsp;aspect has been showing its its age and so has been replaced with the new functionality described above.Most of the code will be migrated automatically.
