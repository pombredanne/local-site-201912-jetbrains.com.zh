If you would prefer a more lightweight introduction into defining your first type-system rules, consider checking out the <a href="cookbook-type-system.html">Type-system cookbook</a>.</p>   <p id="5870a354">If you would like to get familiar with the ways you can use the type-system from your code, you may also look at the <a href="using-typesystem.html">Using the type-system</a> chapter.&nbsp;</p>   <h2 id="whatisatypesystem?">What is a typesystem?</h2>   <p id="c64b8770">A typesystem is a part of a language definition assigning types to the nodes in the models written using the language. The typesystem language is also used to check certain constraints on nodes and their types. Information about types of nodes is useful for:</p>   <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="98be2e34"><p>finding type errors</p></li><li class="list__item" id="fba1828f"><p>checking conditions on nodes' types during generation to apply only appropriate generator rules</p></li><li class="list__item" id="ec9923bc"><p>providing information required for certain refactorings (for example, for the "extract variable" refactoring)</p></li><li class="list__item" id="6761f528"><p>and more</p></li></ul>      <h2 id="types">Types</h2>   <p id="7bc1d797">Any MPS node may serve as a type. To enable MPS to assign types to nodes of your language, you should create a language aspect for typesystem. The typesystem model for your language will be written in the typesystem language.</p>      <h2 id="inferencerules">Inference Rules</h2>   <p id="31547086">The main concept of the typesystem language is an <b id="0ce526dc">inference rule</b>. An inference rule for a certain concept is mainly responsible for computing a type for instances of that concept.</p>   <p id="130e14cd">An inference rule consists of a condition and a body. A condition is used to determine whether a rule is applicable to a certain node. A <b id="f154025f">condition</b> may be of two kinds: a <b id="02b023f8">concept reference</b> or a <b id="08dad4c6">pattern</b>. A rule with a condition in the form of concept reference is applicable to every instance of that concept and its subconcepts. A rule with a pattern is applicable to nodes that match the pattern. A node matches a pattern if it has the same properties and references as the pattern, and if its children match the pattern's children. A pattern also may contain several variables which match everything.</p>   <p id="0b75bc96">The <b id="77202dcb">body</b> of an inference rule is a list of statements which are executed when a rule is applied to a node. The main kind of statements of typesystem language are statements used for creating <b id="f40a7660">equations</b> and <b id="6f2aae50">inequations</b> between types.</p>   <p id="518c806b">An inference rule may define the <b id="b459176f">overrides</b>&nbsp;block, which is a boolean flag that tells the typechecker that, in case there are other inference rules applicable to the superconcepts of the concept specified in the condition, this inference rule takes precedence, and all the rules for superconcepts are ignored. The version 3.3 brings possibility to use a code block instead of a static flag.</p>   <p id="2f963178">Starting with the version 3.3, the inference rules that are applicable to instances of node attributes have additional features that allow for overriding or amending the rules applied to the attributed node. This, for example, can be used to implement alternate type inference based on presence conditions, which can take into account the parameters specified at the project or system level.</p>   <p id="61d99f45">In case an inference rule is applicable to a node attribute, there is also a possibility to tell the typechecker that this rule <b id="d6cdff75">supercedes</b>&nbsp;the rules applicable to the attributed node, which are then ignored. Also, the attributed node is accessible in all rule's code blocks as <b id="ae9b56ec">attributedNode</b>.</p>   <p id="bb2de782">&nbsp;</p>      <h3 id="inferencemethods">Inference Methods</h3>   <p id="d5bcb650">To avoid duplications, one may want to extract identical parts of code of several inference rules to a method. An inference method is just a simple Base Language method marked with an annotation "<code class="code">@InferenceMethod</code>". There are several language constructions you may use only inside inference rules and replacement rules and inference methods, they are: <b id="a8054eac">typeof</b>&nbsp;expressions, <b id="0296228a">equations</b> and <b id="3fb85001">inequations</b>, <b id="568e17cd">when concrete</b>&nbsp;statements, <b id="ed8a1e20">type variable declarations</b> and <b id="9d35c11e">type variable references</b>, and <b id="1bdcc2b5">invocations of inference methods</b>. That is made for not to use such constructions in arbitrary methods, which may be called in arbitrary context, maybe not during type checking.</p>      <h3 id="overriding">Overriding</h3>   <p id="6a5962cd">A type-system rule of a sub-concept can override the rules defined on the super-concepts. If the <i id="fe666e42">overrides</i>&nbsp;flag is set to <i id="3b98bc15">false</i>, the rule is added to the list of rules applied to a concept together with the rules defined for the super-concepts, while, if the flag is set to <i id="bb5311d0">true</i>, the <i id="35922202">overriding</i>&nbsp;rule replaces the rules of the super-concepts in the rule engine and so they do not take effect. This applies both to <i id="c3dc01c9">Inference</i>&nbsp;and <i id="3865b2dd">NonTypeSystem</i>&nbsp;rules.</p>      <h2 id="equationsandinequations">Equations And Inequations</h2>   <p id="5931ac58">The main process which is performed by the <b id="a8148f9c">type-system engine</b> is the process of solving <b id="7121b145">equations</b> and <b id="207c0a64">inequations</b> among all the types. A language designer tells the engine, which equations it should solve by writing them in <b id="6a9d68cb">inference rules</b>. To add an equation into an engine, the following statement is used:&nbsp;</p>   <p id="8bec4798">      <code class="code">expr1 :==: expr2</code>, where <code class="code">expr1</code> and <code class="code">expr2</code> are expressions, which evaluate to a <b id="8a64e3af">node</b>.</p>   <p id="ea3d05c3">Consider the following use case. You want to say that the type of a local variable reference is equal to the type of the variable declaration it points to. So, you write <code class="code">typeof (varRef) :==: typeof (varRef.localVariableDeclaration)</code>, and that's all. The typesystem engine will solve such equations automatically.</p>   <p id="98897fd1">The above-mentioned expression <code class="code">typeof(expr)</code> (where <code class="code">expr</code> must evaluate to an MPS node) is a language construct, which returns a so-called type variable, which serves as a <b id="aa4c0c18">type</b> of that node. Type variables become <b id="c72ade0d">concrete types</b> gradually during the process of equation solving.</p>   <p id="c1f86358">In certain situations you want to say that a certain type doesn't have to <b id="952a173b">exactly equal another type</b>, but also may be a <b id="76abeb80">subtype</b> or a <b id="6dbc4e3a">supertype</b> of that type. For instance, the type of the actual parameter of a method call does not necessarily have to be the same type as that of the method's formal parameter - it can be its subtype. For example, a method, which requires an Object as a parameter, may be applied also to a String.</p>   <p id="ebc9b76b">To express such a constraint, you may use an <b id="d34c1892">inequation</b> instead of an <b id="a1aaffc5">equation</b>. An inequation expresses the fact that a certain type should be a subtype of another type. It is written as follows: <code class="code">expr1 :&lt;=: expr2</code>.</p>      <h2 id="weakandstrongsubtyping">Weak And Strong Subtyping</h2>   <p id="1b312522">A relationship of subtyping is useful for several different cases. You want a type of an actual parameter to be a subtype of formal parameter type, or you want a type of an assigned value to be a subtype of variable's declared type; in method calls or field access operations you want a type of an operand to be a subtype of a method's declaring class.</p>   <p id="cf4c17b9">Sometimes such demands are somewhat controversial: consider, for instance, two types, int and Integer, which you want to be interchangeable when you pass parameters of such types to a method: if a method is <code class="code">doSomething(int i)</code>, it is legal to call <code class="code">doSomething(1)</code> as well as&nbsp;<code class="code">doSomething(new Integer(1))</code>. But when these types are used as types for operand of, say, a method call, the situation is the different: you shouldn't be able to call a method of an expression of type <i id="1e0abf02">int</i>, of an integer constant for example. So, we have to conclude that in one sense <code class="code">int</code> and <code class="code">Integer</code> are subtypes of one another, while in the other sense they are not.</p>   <p id="cf359f76">For solving such a controversy, we introduce two relationships of subtyping: namely, <b id="ce27a31a">weak</b> and <b id="f59d0866">strong</b> subtyping. Weak subtyping will follow from strong subtyping: <b id="053256b8">if a node is a strong subtype of another node, then it is it's weak subtype also</b>.</p>   <p id="3bc3f1fd">Then, we can say about our example, that int and Integer are weak subtypes of each other, but they are not strong subtypes. <b id="c13a8fd6">Assignment and parameters passing require weak subtyping only, method calls require strong subtyping</b>.</p>   <p id="5ba64b51">When you create an inequation in you typesystem, you may choose it to be a strong or weak inequation. Also subtyping rules, those which state subtyping relationship (see below), can be either weak or strong. A weak inequation looks like <code class="code">:&lt;=:</code>, a strong inequation looks like <code class="code">:&lt;&lt;=:</code>   </p>   <p id="75f3c1ec">In most cases you want to state strong subtyping, and to check weak subtyping. If you are not sure, which subtyping you need, use weak one for inequations, strong one for subtyping rules.</p>      <h2 id="subtypingrules">Subtyping Rules</h2>   <p id="562d3eaf">When the typesystem engine solves inequations, it requires information about whether a type is a subtype of another type. But how does the typesystem engine know about that? It uses <b id="b365cd86">subtyping rules</b>. Subtyping rules are used to express subtyping relationship between types. In fact, a subtyping rule is a function which, given a type, returns its immediate supertypes.</p>   <p id="cf660cb9">A subtyping rule consists of a condition (which can be either a concept reference or a pattern) and a body, which is a list of statements that compute and return a node or a list of nodes that are immediate supertypes of the given node. When checking whether some type A is a supertype of another type B, the typesystem engine applies subtyping rules to B and computes its immediate supertypes, then applies subtyping rules to those supertypes and so on. If type A is among the computed supertypes of type B, the answer is "yes".</p>   <p id="96f31b3f">By default, subtyping stated by subtyping rules is a strong one. If you want to state only weak subtyping, set "is weak" property of a rule to "true".</p>      <h2 id="comparisoninequationsandcomparisonrules">Comparison Inequations And Comparison Rules</h2>   <p id="390430a1">Consider you want to write a rule for <i id="910971a9">EqualsExpression</i> (operator <code class="code">==</code> in Java, BaseLanguage and some other languages): you want left operand and right operand of <i id="9b375e17">EqualsExpression</i> to be comparable, that is either type of a left operand should be a (non-strict) subtype of a right operand, or vice versa. To express this, you write a comparison inequation, in a form <code class="code">expr1 :~: expr2</code>, where <i id="c9167c93">expr1</i> and <i id="054f8edd">expr2</i> are expressions, which represent types. Such an inequation is fulfilled if <code class="code">expr1</code> is a subtype of <code class="code">expr2</code>       <code class="code">(</code>      <code class="code">expr1 &lt;: expr2</code>      <code class="code">)</code>, <b id="85b57068">or</b>       <code class="code">expr2 &lt;: expr1</code>.</p>   <p id="6b525ba5">Then, consider that, say, any Java interfaces should also be comparable, even if such interfaces are not subtypes of one another. That is because there always can be written a class, which implements both of interfaces, so variables of interface types can contain the same node, and variable of an interface type can be cast to any other interface. hence an <i id="397e5b37">equation</i>, <i id="0646e484">cast</i>, or <i id="9769786c">instanceof</i> expressions with both types being interface types should be legal (and, for example, in Java they are).</p>   <p id="7c963b19">To state such a comparability, which does not stem from subtyping relationships, you should use <b id="16bc326d">comparison rules</b>. A comparison rule consists of two conditions for the two applicable types and a body which returns true if the types are comparable or false if they are not.</p>   <p id="61c29ec1">Here's the comparison rule for interface types:</p>comparison rule interfaces_are_comparable    <div class="code-block" data-lang="none">applicable for  concept = ClassifierType as classifierType1 , concept = ClassifierType as classifierType2
    applicable always

    classifierType2.classifier.isInstanceOf(Interface)) {
    return true;
    } else {
    return false;
    }
    }</div>   <h2 id="quotations">Quotations</h2>   <p id="038e43f5">A quotation is a language construct that lets you easily create a node with a required structure. Of course, you can create a node using the <i id="62787061">smodelLanguage</i>&nbsp;and then populate it with appropriate children, properties and references by hand, using the same <i id="bdea7a78">smodelLanguage</i>. However, there's a simpler - and more visual - way to accomplish this.</p>   <p id="d8d0664f">A quotation is an expression, whose value is the MPS node written inside the quotation. Think about a quotation as a "node literal", a construction similar to numeric constants and string literals. That is, you write a literal if you statically know what value do you mean. So inside a quotation you don't write an expression, which evaluates to a node, you rather write the node itself. For instance, an expression <code class="code">2 + 3</code> evaluates to <code class="code">5</code>, an expression <code class="code">&lt; 2 + 3 &gt;</code> (angled braces being quotation braces) evaluates to a node <i id="a44f1c58">PlusExpression</i> with <i id="6f343abc">leftOperand</i> being an&nbsp;<i id="3c1a5fb3">IntegerConstant 3</i> and <i id="c0447be3">rightOperand</i> being <i id="f5ec9a68">IntegerConstant</i>       <code class="code">5</code>.</p>   <p id="fe5555a9">(See the <a href="quotations.html">Quotations</a> documentation for more details on quotations, anti quotations and light quotations)</p>      <h2 id="antiquotations">Antiquotations</h2>   <p id="ea498ff5">For it is a literal, a value of quotation should be known statically. On the other hand, in cases when you know some parts (i.e. children, referents or properties) of your node only dynamically, i.e. those parts that can only be evaluated at runtime and are not known at design time, then you can't use just a quotation to create a node with such parts.</p>   <p id="56f2067e">The good news, however, is that if you know the most part of a node statically and you want to replace only several parts by dynamically-evaluated nodes you can use <b id="2d021c8c">antiquotations</b>. An antiquotation can be of 4 types: <i id="b4459b48">child</i>, <i id="ba823069">reference</i>, <i id="026a1d6f">property</i> and <i id="776ac790">list</i> antiquotation. They all contain an expression, which evaluates dynamically to replace a part of the quoted node by its result. Child and referent antiquotations evaluate to a node, property antiquotation evaluates to string and list antiquotation evaluates to a list of nodes.</p>   <p id="d44b427a">For instance, you want to create a <i id="5cf26ab4">ClassifierType</i> with the class <i id="b330c345">ArrayList</i>, but its type parameter is known only dynamically, for instance by calling a method, say, "computeMyTypeParameter()".</p>   <p id="8c7c1852">Thus, you write the following expression: <i id="8846368f">&lt; ArrayList &lt; %( computeMyTypeParameter() )% &gt; &gt;</i>. The construction <i id="44a0ed5d">%(...)%</i> here is a node antiquotation.</p>   <p id="03c03a4d">You may also antiquotate reference targets and property values, with <i id="7359bbbc">^(...)^</i> and <i id="ec304130">$(...)$</i>, respectively; or a list of children of one role, using <i id="85f46d5c">*(...)*</i>.</p>   <p id="9312da99">a) If you want to replace a node somewhere inside a quoted node with a node evaluated by an expression, you use node antiquotation, that is %( )%. As you may guess there's no sense to replace the whole quoted node with an antiquotation with an expression inside, because in such cases you could instead write such an expression directly in your program.</p>   <p id="a9aa4dd4">So node antiquotations are used to replace children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and other descendants of a quoted node. Thus, an expression inside of antiquotation should return a node. To write such an antiquotation, position your caret on a cell for a child and type "%".</p>   <p id="5d478783">b) If you want to replace a target of a reference from somewhere inside a quoted node with a node evaluated by an expression, you use reference antiquotation, that is ^(...)^. To write such an antiquotation, position your caret on a cell for a referent and type "^".</p>   <p id="842ec3c4">c) If you want to replace a child (or some more deeply located descendant), which is of a multiple-cardinality role, and if for that reason you may want to replace it not with a single node but rather with several ones, then use child list (simply list for brevity) antiquotations, *( )*<b id="9bf178d4">. </b>An expression inside a list antiquotation should return a list of nodes, that is of type <i id="3b010698">nlist&lt;..&gt;</i> or compatible type (i.e.<i id="deb7a2f7"> list&lt;node&lt;..&gt;&gt;</i> is ok, too, as well as some others). To write such an antiquotation, position your caret on a cell for a child inside a child collection and type "*". You cannot use it on an empty child collection, so before you press "*" you have to enter a single child inside it.</p>   <p id="0e362e44">d) If you want to replace a property value of a quoted node by a dynamicаlly calculated value, use property antiquotation $( )$. An expression inside a quotation should return string, which will be a value for an antiquoted property of a quoted node. To write such an antiquotation, position your caret on a cell for a property and type "$".</p>   <p id="65888568">(See the&nbsp;<a href="quotations.html">Quotations</a>&nbsp;documentation for more details on quotations, anti quotations and light quotations)</p>      <h2 id="examplesofinferencerules">Examples Of Inference Rules</h2>   <p id="d5be73f1">Here are the simplest basic use cases of an inference rule:</p>   <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="5fd44e7d">         <p id="69aa9e90">to assign the same type to all instances of a concept (useful mainly for literals):</p>          <div class="code-block" data-lang="none">applicable to concept = StringLiteral as nodeToCheck

Also, it may be a node which contains some type variables as its children or further descendants. A type variable represents an undefined type, which may then become a concrete type, as a result of solving equations that contain this type variable.</p>   <p id="7c8f0380">Type variables appear at runtime mainly as a result of the "typeof" operation, but you can create them manually, if you want to. There's a statement called <i id="d70903b9">TypeVarDeclaration</i> in the typesystem lanuage to do so. You write it like "var T" or "var X" or "var V", i.e. "var" followed by the name of a type variable. Then you may use your variable, for example, in antiquotations to create a node with type variables inside.</p>   <p id="a63f8495">Example: an inference rule for "for each" loop. A "for each" loop in Java consists of a loop body, an iterable to iterate over, and a variable into which the next member of an iterable is assigned before the next iteration. An iterable should be either an instance of a subclass of the Iterable interface, or an array. To simplify the example, we don't consider the case of the iterable being an array. Therefore, we need to express the following: <i id="ad11e423">an iterable's type should be a subtype of an Iterable of something</i>, and <i id="6a69cfc1">the variable's type should be a supertype of that very something</i>.

The problem is, however, that one can't just inspect a result of "typeof" expression because it may be a type variable at that moment. Although a type variable usually will become a concrete type at some moment, it can't be guaranteed that it is concrete in some given point of your typesystem code.</p>   <p id="1b2c12ad">To solve such a problem you can use a "when concrete" block.</p>    <div class="code-block" data-lang="none">when concrete ( expr as var ) {

A body is a list of statements which will be executed only when a type denoted by "expr" becomes concrete, thus inside the body of a when concrete block you may safely inspect its children, properties, etc. if you need to.</p>   <p id="fc95ad32">If you have written a when concrete block and look into its inspector you will see two options: "is shallow" and "skip error". If you set "is shallow" to "true", the body of your when concrete block will be executed when expression becomes shallowly concrete, i.e. becomes not a type variable itself but possibly has type variables as children or referents. Normally, if your expression in condition of when concrete block is never concrete, then an error is reported.

Then you want to say that your function types are <i id="c6655421">covariant</i> by their return types and <i id="2723423e">contravariant</i> by their argument types. That is, a function type F = (T 1, .., T N) -&gt; R is a subtype of a function type G = (S 1, .., S N) -&gt; Q (written as F &lt;: G) if and only if R &lt;: Q (covariant by return type) and for any K from 1 to N, T K :&gt; S K (that is, contravariant by arguments types).</p>   <p id="fe863257">The problem is, how to express covariance and contravariance in the typesystem language? Using subtyping rules you may express covariance by writing something like this:</p>    <div class="code-block" data-lang="none">nlist &lt;  &gt; result = new nlist &lt;  &gt; ;
    for ( node &lt;  &gt; returnTypeSupertype : immediateSupertypes ( functionType . returnType ) ) {
    node &lt;FunctionType&gt; ft = functionType . copy;
    ft . returnType = returnTypeSupertype;
    result . add ( ft ) ;
    }
    return  result ;</div><p id="3d1517e7">Okay, we have collected all immediate supertypes for a function's return type and have created a list of function types with those collected types as return types and with original argument types. But, first, if we have many supertypes of return type, it's not very efficient to perform such an action each time we need to solve an inequation, and second, although now we have covariance by function's return type, we still don't have contravariance by function's arguments' types. We can't collect immediate subtypes of a certain type because subtyping rules give us supertypes, not subtypes.</p>   <p id="b4370e3f">In fact, we just want to express the abovementioned property: F = (T 1, .., T N) -&gt; R &lt;: G = (S 1, .., S N) -&gt; Q (written as F &lt;: G) if and only if R &lt;: Q and for any K from 1 to N, T K :&gt; S K. For this and similar purposes the typesystem language has a notion called "replacement rule."</p>      <h3 id="what'sareplacementrule?">What's a replacement rule?</h3>   <p id="62002ea2">A replacement rule provides a convenient way to solve inequations. While the standard way is to transitively apply subtyping rules to a should-be-subtype until a should-be-supertype is found among the results (or is never found among the results), a replacement rule, if applicable to an inequation, removes the inequation and then executes its body (which usually contains "create equation" and "create inequation" statements).</p>      <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>   <p id="8d430d4e">A replacement rule for above-mentioned example is written as follows:</p>    <div class="code-block" data-lang="none">replacement rule  FunctionType_subtypeOf_FunctionType
    applicable for  concept = FunctionType as functionSubType &lt;: concept = FunctionType as functionSuperType
    rule {
    if ( functionSubType . parameterType . count != functionSuperType . parameterType . count ) {
    error " different parameter numbers " -&gt; equationInfo . getNodeWithError (  ) ;
    return ;
    }
    functionSubType . returnType :&lt;=:  functionSuperType . returnType ;
    foreach ( node &lt;  &gt; paramType1 : functionSubType . parameterType ;&nbsp;
    node &lt;  &gt; paramType2 : functionSuperType . parameterType ) {
    paramType2 :&lt;=:  paramType1 ;
    }
    }</div><p id="4e9a173f">Here we say that a rule is applicable to a should-be-subtype of concept FunctionType and a should-be-supertype of concept FunctionType. The body of a rule ensures that the number of parameter types of function types are equal, otherwise it reports an error and returns. If the numbers of parameter types of both function types are equal, a rule creates an inequation with return types and appropriate inequation for appropriate parameter types.</p>   <p id="93096401">Another simple example of replacement rules usage is a rule, which states that a Null type (a type of null literal) is a subtype of every type except primitive ones. Of course, we can't write a subtyping rule for Null type, which returns a list of <b id="0979fc01">all</b> types. Instead, we write the following replacement rule:</p>    <div class="code-block" data-lang="none">replacement rule  any_type_supertypeof_nulltype
    applicable for  concept = NullType as nullType &lt;: concept = BaseConcept as baseConcept
    rule {
    if ( baseConcept . isInstanceOf ( PrimitiveType ) ) {
    error "null type is not a subtype of primitive type " -&gt; equationInfo.getNodeWithError (  ) ;
    }
    }</div><p id="56071982">This rule is applicable to any should-be-supertype and to those should-be-subtypes which are Null types. The only thing this rule does is checking whether should-be-supertype is an instance of PrimitiveType concept. If it is, the rule reports an error. If is not, the rule does nothing, therefore the inequation to solve is simply removed from the typesystem engine with no further effects.</p>      <h3 id="differentsemantics">Different semantics</h3>   <p id="ab7ebb6b">A semantic of a replacement rule, as explained above, is to replace an inequation with some other equations and inequations or to perform some other actions when applied. This semantic really doesn't state that a certain type is a subtype of another type under some conditions. It just defines how to solve an inequation with those two types.</p>   <p id="e466a960">For example, suppose that during generation you need to inspect whether some statically unknown type is a subtype of String. What will an engine answer when a type to inspect is Null type? When we have an inequation, a replacement rule can say that it is true, but for this case its abovementioned semantics is unuseful: we have no inequations, we have a question to answer yes or no. With function types, it is worse because a rule says that we should create some inequations. So, what do we have to do with them in our use case?</p>   <p id="96d920e7">To make replacement rules usable when we want to inspect whether a type is a subtype of another type, a different semantic is given to replacement rules in such a case.</p>   <p id="43839898">This semantic is as follows: each "add equation" statement is treated as an inspection of whether two nodes match; each "add inequation" statement is treated as an inspection of whether one node is a subtype of another; each report error statement is treated as "return false."</p>   <p id="c3212ced">Consider the above replacement rule for function types:</p>    <div class="code-block" data-lang="none">replacement rule  FunctionType_subtypeOf_FunctionType

    foreach ( node &lt;  &gt; paramType1 : functionSubType . parameterType ; node &lt;  &gt; paramType2 : functionSuperType . parameterType ) {
    paramType2 :&lt;=:  paramType1 ;

That is to say, it may be a node in the program or be created with a quotation. In both cases, the result of evaluating the expression that specifies type to be assigned by either equation or inequality statement, literally represents target type. This feature allows to substitute another node to represent type instead.</p>   <p id="92a270e5">For example, one might decide to use different types for different program configurations, such as using <code class="code">int</code> or <code class="code">long</code> depending on whether the task requires using one type or another.

The typechecker tries to apply all matching substitution rules exhaustively, until no more substitutions are available. Only then the type appears in the internal model of the typechecker. Some precautions are taken to prevent the typechecker from going into an endless cycle of substitutions, such as A -&gt; B -&gt; A, but these are not perfect and one should be careful so as to not to introduce infinite cycles.&nbsp;</p>      <h3 id="check-onlyinequations">Check-only inequations</h3>   <p id="f768761f">Basically, inequations may affect nodes' types, for instance if one of the inequation part is a type variable, it may become a concrete type because of this inequation. But, sometimes one does not want a certain inequation to create types, only to check whether such an inequation is satisfied. We call such inequations check-only inequations. To mark an inequation as a check-only, one should go to this inequation's inspector and should set a flag "check-only" to "true". To visually distinguish such inequations, the "less or equals" sign for check-only inequation is gray, while for normal ones it is black, so you can see whether an inequation is check-only without looking at its inspector.</p>      <h3 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h3>   <p id="a61fd2f8">When writing a generator for a certain language (see generator), one may want to ask for a type of a certain node in generator queries. When generator generates a model, such a query will make typesystem engine do some typechecking to find out the type needed. Performing full typechecking of a node's containing root to obtain the node's type is expensive and almost always unnecessary. In most cases, the typechecker should check only the node given. In more difficult cases, obtaining the type of a given node may require checking its parent or maybe a further ancestor. The typechecking engine will check a given node if the computed type is not fully concrete (i.e. contains one or more type variables); then the typechecker will check the node's parent, and so on.</p>   <p id="0f892037">Sometimes there's an even more complex case: the type of a certain node being computed in isolation is fully concrete; and the type of the same node - in a certain environment - is fully concrete also, but differs from the first one. In such a case, the abovementioned algorithm will break, returning the type of an node as if being isolated, which is not the correct type for the given node.</p>   <p id="7ab9ab6c">To solve this kind of problem, you can give some hints to the typechecker. Such hints are called dependencies - they express a fact that a node's type depends on some other node. Thus, when computing a type of a certain node during generation, if this node has some dependencies they will be checked also, so the node will be type-checked in an appropriate environment. A dependency is expressed by using the typeOf expression on the node, the type of which is needed for proper computation of the requested type.</p>   <h2 id="overridingtypeofliteralorexpression">Overriding type of literal or expression</h2>   <p id="759f5cfb">In addition to type substitution rules, which are only applicable to types, we introduce support for attributes in the inference rules.&nbsp;</p>   <h3 id="inferencerules">Inference rules</h3>   <p id="c74d4095">Literals or expressions usually have associated type inference rules that get triggered when the typechecker requires type of the node in question.
