It includes a brief discussion of the        IDE concept, then explores specific differences.</p>       <div class="chapter"><h2 id="what_is_an_ide" data-toc="Migrating_from_Text_Editors#what_is_an_ide">What is an IDE?</h2>        <p id="df15f383">Python developers have long used a variety of tools to write their code. Although the            lines are blurry, these tools fall into two broad camps: text editors and integrated            development environments (IDEs). Text editors, to oversimplify, focus on the editing            of a single file, giving a very lean-and-mean experience.        </p>        <p id="d9d1b1c3">IDEs, as the name implies, have a broader view. They want to look at your entire project,            and all of your coding-related activities, and unify these into a consistent, powerful            UI. While these two segments overlap, the overall scope is the primary difference.        </p>        <p id="1004b5f2">Because an IDE like PyCharm looks at all of the code -- in your project, in your            dependencies, and in the platform itself -- it can provide much assistance in coding            activities. This analysis and assistance shows in many powerful facilities:        </p>        <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="fd523565"><p><b id="7e971875">Auto-completion</b> speeds up accurate coding by finishing your typing</p></li><li class="list__item" id="67f7393f"><p><b id="f361eb3a">Quick fixes</b> spot common mistakes and provide language-specific corrections</p></li><li class="list__item" id="4fd0a15d"><p><b id="15e0673a">Code Intentions</b> suggest optimizations and improvements for common Python patterns</p></li><li class="list__item" id="33aab2de"><p><b id="8d0434df">Code Refactoring</b> takes the drudgery out of frequently-used Python refactoring</p></li><li class="list__item" id="416e1860"><p><b id="1854f203">Templates</b> automate recurring tasks</p></li><li class="list__item" id="d3dcfe5d"><p><b id="8c8e9df1">Code Navigation</b> analyzes the structure and semantics of all your code, and                code it uses, to provide rich ways to move around in your software</p></li></ul>        <p id="490ee563">While text editors provide some of these facilities, PyCharm goes beyond string-oriented            operations and addresses the <i id="3a267c0c">semantics</i> of your code and the language, providing intelligent            assistance. PyCharm understands Python, and understands your code, so it can jump to where a            symbol is defined, or where your class is used, or refactor a method and its usages across            the code base. In fact, these capabilities extend beyond Python: from its brethren in the            IntelliJ family, PyCharm inherits first-class IDE support for web development and many other            areas.</p>        <p id="43cc6f16">Beyond these coding assistance facilities, PyCharm ties in related operations into the            same environment: version control, database management, profiling, test running, remote            environments, and more. Each of these facilities is delivered in an integrated fashion:            applying a change while view a diff can automatically trigger a re-run of your tests.</p>        <p id="2e08f0d1">Finally, this power comes with a product-focused mindset: everything just works. While            other tools have a long list of <i id="e4d914a8">possible</i> capabilities, you’re on your own to assemble            and maintain the aggregate. That’s fine for people that like to tinker. With PyCharm as            your IDE, these features work, out-of-the-box, and are professionally supported, year            after year.</p>    </div>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="user_interface" data-toc="Migrating_from_Text_Editors#user_interface">The PyCharm interface</h2>        <p id="12eb05d3">Since an IDE such as PyCharm has such a broad scope, the user interface (UI) requires            more orientation than a simple text editor.

It also provides quick access to the project interpreter settings.</p></li></ol>                    <p id="ccd90a9b">Still too much? If you are transitioning from a text editor and want the spartan look,            PyCharm has several solutions:</p>        <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="7b700b52"><p>Windows and toolbars can be hidden until needed</p></li><li class="list__item" id="83a82d5d"><p><a href="ide-viewing-modes.html#distraction-free">Distraction-free mode</a>                and the other modes remove most of the visual chrome,                focusing on the code with interaction done via keyboard shortcuts and action searches</p></li></ul>        <p id="6edad698">In fact, PyCharm has embraced the modern, uncluttered trend by surfacing most of            its operations via a keyboard-centric, search-oriented interaction.

Not just the software that accompanies the project, but the related            tasks as well.</p>        <p id="91d01fcc">The project contains more than just these artifacts. In a project, you might have 3            files open in tabs, in a certain order. That information is saved in the project’s            metadata, in a .idea subdirectory in the project’s root folder, Because of this, the            next time you open the project, you will be restored to that configuration. This            applies beyond configuration: PyCharm <a href="working-with-source-code.html#intro">
            PyCharm automatically saves changes that you make in your files.
            Saving is triggered by various events, such as compiling, running, debugging,
            performing version control operations, closing a file or a project, or quitting the IDE.
            Most of the actual events are predefined and cannot be configured, but you can be sure that changes will
            not be lost as you work.

PyCharm has a tremendous amount in its IDE that is part of the project’s configuration:            Python settings, scenarios for running code, connection information for databases, and more.</p>    </div>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="first_project" data-toc="Migrating_from_Text_Editors#first_project">Your first project</h2>        <p id="60330557">If you currently use a text editor, your first step into PyCharm will ask you about creating            a project. You have a number of options and opportunities. Let’s discuss some of them.</p>        <p id="330cb247">First, you might be starting from a blank slate, or from an existing directory on disk, or with            a remote repository that you have yet to check out. PyCharm            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rSBPGGLkW0&amp;list=PLQ176FUIyIUZ1mwB-uImQE-gmkwzjNLjP&amp;index=2" data-external="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has specific facilities to help</a>            in all of these cases. It’s really nice, for example, to be able to browse your            GitHub account’s repositories when choosing your project’s starting point.</p>        <p id="973dedda">Next, you might have one or more Python interpreters that you want to use with your project. PyCharm            supports locally-installed Python 2 and 3, as well as making or re-using virtual environments.            It also supports Anaconda-based interpreters, remote interpreters, Vagrant,            and Docker. You can set these up before you start PyCharm’s “New Project” wizard, or            specify (or even create) these during project creation. As well, you can change your mind            after you create your project.</p>        <p id="0dda2063">With PyCharm Professional Edition, we make it easy to get started with popular types of projects. For            example, creating a Django project will generate a directory structure following Django best            practices and add a “run configuration” that starts up the Django server in a special tool            window.</p>                <figure><img alt="Creating a new project" title="Creating a new project" src="/help/img/idea/2019.2/py_create_project.png" id="0335b195" width="700" height="964"></figure>    </div>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="vim_plugin" data-toc="Migrating_from_Text_Editors#vim_plugin">IdeaVim</h2>        <p id="dd88d7aa">Long-time <span class="emphasis">vim</span> users have a lot invested in how they use their editor.

For example, while it ships with a light theme by default,           it also provides an optional, darker theme called “Darcula” which matches modern trends in editors. Beyond           tweaking `heme, numerous look-and-feel options can be customized: font sizes, color schemes, toolbar           settings, balloon behavior, and more.</p>       <p id="b8256f3c">“How it looks” is just the beginning of the customization options. We discussed switching to a different           <a href="mastering-keyboard-shortcuts.html">bundled keymap</a>. But you can can extend and customize the keymap in many ways,           mapping different keystrokes to different actions. Beyond that, PyCharm’s behavior can be extended:           installing plugins, custom “templates” for actions, changing the code intentions, and so on.</p>   </div>   <div class="chapter"><h2 id="multiple_cursors" data-toc="Migrating_from_Text_Editors#multiple_cursors">Multiple cursors</h2>       <p id="888819c0">Here’s a power feature that developers from other tools swear by: multiple cursors.

With                      <a href="working-with-source-code.html#editor_lines_code_blocks">PyCharm's multicursor</a>, multiple carets can be used, with IDE actions applying to           each caret.

These tools go beyond just the basics: you           can move around between these areas in rich ways, split vertically or horizontally, re-split, and do all of           this from the keyboard.</p>       <p id="79891154">PyCharm also has a <span>mature set of capabilities</span>           for showing multiple files. At its most basic, you can open multiple files into tabs, which can be           re-organized manually or sorted alphabetically. Tabs can be pinned or detached into a separate window.</p>              <p id="3e4212db">Beyond tabs, you can           <a href="using-code-editor.html#split_screen">split the editor window</a>           into independent panes to show more           than one file/tab at a time.

These let you define parameters that are            associated with running the Python (or other languages such as JavaScript) code. Then, when you run that run            configuration, all the associated settings are applied.</p>        <p id="27448860">Moreover, PyCharm runs your code in a specialized tool window which provides many features for working with            running code: stopping, re-running, and so on. The output is displayed in a mini-console and errors show a            traceback with lines that can be clicked to jump to that file’s line number. This tool window, as well as            running and re-running your code, can all be driven from a keyboard.</p>        <p id="0c3bc319">These run configurations also apply to special kinds of running: test runner configurations with a            specialized window for showing test output, debug configurations with the visual debugger, a test coverage            run configuration, a profiler run configuration, and even a concurrency diagram configuration. All of these            provide real value to the professional Python developer’s workflow.</p>        <p id="f6644024">Finally, PyCharm Professional adds new types of run configurations for the frameworks it supports. For            example the Pyramid run configuration knows about the Pyramid configuration file and capabilities unique            to Pyramid.</p>   </div>   <div class="chapter"><h2 id="tips_and_tricks" data-toc="Migrating_from_Text_Editors#tips_and_tricks">Productivity tips</h2>       <dl><dt id="19ce2e7c">Running from command-line</dt><dd>               <p id="3ec0415f">While PyCharm is traditionally launched like other applications (from the desktop), you can also                   <a href="working-with-the-ide-features-from-command-line.html">work with PyCharm from the command line</a>                   These can be setup during initial install.

PyCharm itself has almost 500 plugins, covering many different categories.</p>               <p id="3d172712">In fact, the PyCharm IDE itself is composed of plugins. This is why, for example, PyCharm inherits many                   web features from WebStorm: they share the same core functionality via plugins.</p>               <p id="34e21cfe">Via PyCharm’s Settings/Preferences dialog, <a href="managing-plugins.html#repos">plugins</a> can be be browsed, installed,                   updated, and removed. Also, plugins are checked for updates along with PyCharm itself. If a plugin is                   updated, you will be asked to download it and restart PyCharm.</p>           </dd><dt id="e0f74c6e">Polyglot Development</dt><dd>               <p id="7254d5d4">While text editors support many languages alongside Python, PyCharm is unique in the power it brings beyond               Python. For example, PyCharm is a first-class web development IDE. It doesn’t just syntax-highlighting and               autocomplete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides the full spectrum of features: semantically-aware code               inspection, refactoring, debugging, launching a live server, translating SASS files to CSS, browsing npm run               scripts, and so on.</p>           <p id="fdc8a19f">This applies beyond web development as well: IPython Notebook emulation, reStucturedText, and more. How               is PyCharm able to do this? As mentioned above, it shares JetBrains plugins with its other IntelliJ-based               IDE brethren.</p>           </dd><dt id="1a4ca103">Minimap</dt><dd>               <p id="4db576ae">Other tools, such as Sublime Text and Visual Studio (via add-on), provide a visual mode of scrolling through                   a large document. With this, the normal scroll bar is replaced with a graphical thumbnail of the document                   and your current scroll location in it.</p>               <p id="11c85d27">PyCharm users can also get this with the                   <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7275?pr=clion" data-external="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CodeGlance</a>                   JetBrains plugin, which is written to conform to the selected theme.</p>                          </dd></dl>   </div>   <div class="chapter"><h2 id="additional_resources" data-toc="Migrating_from_Text_Editors#additional_resources">Additional resources</h2>        <ul class="list _ul"><li class="list__item" id="8eda5bd5"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ176FUIyIUZ1mwB-uImQE-gmkwzjNLjP" data-external="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getting Started</a>                series of screencasts on YouTube</p></li><li class="list__item" id="9758d167"><p>PyCharm <a href="/pycharm/" data-external="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">home page</a>,                <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/" data-external="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a>, and                <a href="https://twitter.com/pycharm" data-external="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter account</a>.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="c964ed49"><p>,                <a href="keymap-reference.html">keymap reference</a>, and                <a href="using-online-resources.html">using online resources</a>                .</p></li><li class="list__item" id="c6600b7a"><p>Ask questions in the                <a href="https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/200379535-PyCharm" data-external="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community forum</a> or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pycharm" data-external="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StackOverflow topic</a>.</p></li></ul>   </div><div class="last-modified" data-skip-index="skip">Last modified: 6 November 2019 </div><div data-feedback-placeholder="true"></div><div class="navigation-links _bottom" data-skip-index="skip"><a class="navigation-links__prev" href="accessibility.html">Accessibility features</a><a class="navigation-links__next" href="basic-tutorials.html">First Steps</a></div></article><div id="disqus_thread" data-skip-index="skip"></div></div></section></main></div><script src="//resources.jetbrains.com/storage/help-app/v3/app.js"></script></body></html>
