Another related tool is type search, with <a href=\"https://hoogle.haskell.org/\">Hoogle</a> for Haskell libraries being a popular implementation.

Previously, each build tool needed dedicated support in IDEs. But most build tools share many concepts. BSP defines a uniform way to describe projects and interact with tools on common tasks without the IDE needing to support any specifics of the build tool, or vice versa. Your task is to write a BSP server implementation for a build tool of your choice. Ideally you will already have worked with the tool.</p>\n<h3>We offer:</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Fascinating work in a friendly team.</li>\n  <li>Developing products for software developers much like ourselves.</li>\n  <li>Competitive salary.</li>\n  <li>Fixed-term contract with the opportunity for permanent employment.</li>\n  <li>Flexible working schedule.</li>\n  <li>25 working days of paid leave per year.</li>\n  <li>An office library with specialized work-related books and magazines.</li>\n  <li>Training, conferences and team building events</li>\n  <li>Comfortable working environment, with ergonomic workplaces, fitness and leisure zones, company-paid public transportation ticket (MVG) or free parking on the premises.</li>\n  <li>Additional benefits including lunch vouchers, free refreshments, and snacks in the office, and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Please, note:</strong> this position is available only to EU citizens or German work permit holders.</p>", "role": ["Intern"], "technologies": ["Scala"], "location": ["Munich, Germany"], "team": ["Scala"], "language": ["English"]}, {"id": 315, "title": "Software Developer Intern", "slug": "software-developer-intern-315", "description": "<h2>Software Developer Intern</h2>\n<p>A JetBrains industry internship gives you an extraordinary opportunity to become a fully fledged member of the product team and work on challenging problems alongside some of the best developers in the field, to set you up for your future with an invaluable experience and an enhanced skill set.</p>\n<p>JetBrains is building a new cloud-based application for team collaboration.

Even if you use regular expressions, the code is still treated as a regular text. The structural search lets search for a particular code pattern or grammatical construct in code considering the code structure. The downside: each language should be supported separately. Though Java is supported since long ago, Kotlin still lacks the support. For the polyglot projects (like IntelliJ IDEA itself), this means that structural search finds Java code usages but not those from Kotlin. This makes the feature far less useful and in extreme cases even dangerous.</p>\n<p>Within the scope of the internship, you will work on supporting a subset of patterns to match Kotlin code such as e.g. function calls, control constructions, class declarations.</p>\n<h3>Requirements:</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Experience with Java or Kotlin.</li>\n  <li>Good English skills (both writing and speaking).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Even better if you have:</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Basic experience with Git.</li>\n  <li>Experience with IntelliJ IDEA or other Jetbrains IDE.</li>\n  <li>Familiarity with compiler development or code analysis technologies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>We offer:</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Fascinating work in a friendly team.</li>\n  <li>Developing products for software developers much like ourselves.</li>\n  <li>Competitive salary.</li>\n  <li>Fixed-term contract with the opportunity for permanent employment.</li>\n  <li>Flexible working schedule.</li>\n  <li>25 working days of paid leave per year.</li>\n  <li>An office library with specialized work-related books and magazines.</li>\n  <li>Training, conferences and team building events</li>\n  <li>Comfortable working environment, with ergonomic workplaces, fitness and leisure zones, company-paid public transportation ticket (MVG) or free parking on the premises.</li>\n  <li>Additional benefits including lunch vouchers, free refreshments, and snacks in the office, and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Please, note:</strong> this position is available only to EU citizens or German work permit holders.</p>", "role": ["Intern"], "technologies": ["Java", "Kotlin"], "location": ["Munich, Germany"], "team": ["IntelliJ IDEA"], "language": ["English"]}]
